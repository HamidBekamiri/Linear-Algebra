The data for the study were retrieved from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database between 2002 and 2019 and fixed-effects regression analysis was executed. The results indicate that female directors are influential in all aspects of eco-friendly practices while they have the greatest impact on eco-innovation. Furthermore, pursuing a CSR strategy fosters the sector's commitment to eco-friendly practices. Moreover, moderation analysis revealed that while CSR strategy moderates the association between board gender diversity and eco-innovation, moderation is not significant for resource use and emission reduction. However, when we use Shannon and Blau indices, we found stronger evidence of the moderating effect of CSR strategy between board gender diversity and eco-friendly practices. In addition, further tests indicated the existence of some quadratic relationships between test variables and eco-friendly practices. The originality of the study is arising from several aspects such as focusing exclusively on the transportation and logistics sector, adopting three proxies of board gender diversity (i.e., female proportion on board, Shannon Index, and Blau Index), exploring the interaction effect of two governance mechanisms on eco-friendly practices, and testing quadratic relationships between gender diversity and CSR strategy and eco-friendly practices. Furthermore, it investigates very specific environmental topics (i.e., eco-innovation, resource usage, and emissions) rather than CSR performance in general. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Board gender diversity; CSR strategy; Eco-friendly; Eco-innovation; Emission; Resource use; Transportation and logistics sector,Emission control; Regression analysis; Board gender diversity; CSR strategy; Eco-friendly; Eco-innovation; Emission; Gender diversity; Resource use; Reuters; Thomson; Transportation and logistic sector; Environmental protection,"Adams, R.B., Women on boards: the superheroes of tomorrow?

The criticism concerning environmental externalities of the transportation and logistics sector is mounting; hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether board gender diversity stimulates eco-friendly practices and to test whether a CSR strategy moderates this relationship in this sector. The data for the study were retrieved from the Thomson Reuters Eikon database between 2002 and 2019 and fixed-effects regression analysis was executed. The results indicate that female directors are influential in all aspects of eco-friendly practices while they have the greatest impact on eco-innovation. Furthermore, pursuing a CSR strategy fosters the sector's commitment to eco-friendly practices. Moreover, moderation analysis revealed that while CSR strategy moderates the association between board gender diversity and eco-innovation, moderation is not significant for resource use and emission reduction. However, when we use Shannon and Blau indices, we found stronger evidence of the moderating effect of CSR strategy between board gender diversity and eco-friendly practices. In addition, further tests indicated the existence of some quadratic relationships between test variables and eco-friendly practices. The originality of the study is arising from several aspects such as focusing exclusively on the transportation and logistics sector, adopting three proxies of board gender diversity (i.e., female proportion on board, Shannon Index, and Blau Index), exploring the interaction effect of two governance mechanisms on eco-friendly practices, and testing quadratic relationships between gender diversity and CSR strategy and eco-friendly practices. Furthermore, it investigates very specific environmental topics (i.e., eco-innovation, resource usage, and emissions) rather than CSR performance in general. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Board gender diversity, CSR strategy, eco-friendly initiatives transportation logistics sector. criticism concerning environmental externalities transportation logistics sector mounting; hence, study board gender diversity stimulates eco-friendly practices test CSR strategy moderates relationship sector. data study retrieved Thomson Reuters Eikon database 2002 2019 fixed-effects regression analysis executed. results indicate female directors influential aspects eco-friendly practices greatest impact eco-innovation.

As a burgeoning pattern of outward direct investment, reverse cross-border M&As enable EMNCs to access technological resources that are conducive to enhancing innovation efficiency. Deal activity involving Western corporations buying into emerging economies has been extensively studied; conversely, the nature and consequences of reverse cross-border M&As can hardly be explained by internationalization theories. Furthermore, extant studies paid less attention to how diversified knowledge resources affect EMNCs' innovation performance. In contrast, heterogeneous and diversified knowledge has been proven to be vital for generating novel knowledge combinations. We also believe that managerial ability will affect how acquirers reorganize and integrate knowledge, thereby influencing post-acquisition innovation performance. Drawing from the knowledge-based view and upper echelon theory, this study adopted the data of Chinese listed manufacturing corporations that engaged in reverse cross-border M&As from 2010 to 2018 to explore the influencing mechanisms between the two dimensions of knowledge diversity and innovation performance of multinational manufacturing corporations from emerging economies, while managerial ability was additionally analyzed as a mediator of the above relationships. The empirical findings suggested that manufacturing corporations with higher knowledge diversity present better post-acquisition innovation performance. Managerial ability plays a fully mediating effect between the knowledge heterogeneity and innovation performance of EMNCs but imposes a partially mediating effect between technological diversity and innovation performance. The findings help enrich the understanding of the integrating process of reverse cross-border M&A and the endogenous function mechanism of how knowledge diversity and managerial ability affect the promotion of EMNCs’ innovation performance. © 2022",Innovation performance; Knowledge diversity; Managerial ability; Reverse cross-border M&As,Economics; Knowledge based systems; Managers; Mergers and acquisitions; Cross-border; Diversity performance; Emerging economies; Innovation performance; Knowledge diversity; Knowledge innovation; Managerial ability; Mediating effect; Multi-national corporations; Reverse cross-border merger and acquisition; Manufacture,"Ai, Q., Tan, H., The intra-firm knowledge transfer in the outward M&A of EMNCs: evidence from Chinese manufacturing firms (2018) Asia Pac.

There has been an increasing trend that multinational corporations from emerging economies (EMNCs) undertake cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) with corporations in developed economies. As a burgeoning pattern of outward direct investment, reverse cross-border M&As enable EMNCs to access technological resources that are conducive to enhancing innovation efficiency. Deal activity involving Western corporations buying into emerging economies has been extensively studied; conversely, the nature and consequences of reverse cross-border M&As can hardly be explained by internationalization theories. Furthermore, extant studies paid less attention to how diversified knowledge resources affect EMNCs' innovation performance. In contrast, heterogeneous and diversified knowledge has been proven to be vital for generating novel knowledge combinations. We also believe that managerial ability will affect how acquirers reorganize and integrate knowledge, thereby influencing post-acquisition innovation performance. Drawing from the knowledge-based view and upper echelon theory, this study adopted the data of Chinese listed manufacturing corporations that engaged in reverse cross-border M&As from 2010 to 2018 to explore the influencing mechanisms between the two dimensions of knowledge diversity and innovation performance of multinational manufacturing corporations from emerging economies, while managerial ability was additionally analyzed as a mediator of the above relationships. The empirical findings suggested that manufacturing corporations with higher knowledge diversity present better post-acquisition innovation performance. Managerial ability plays a fully mediating effect between the knowledge heterogeneity and innovation performance of EMNCs but imposes a partially mediating effect between technological diversity and innovation performance. The findings help enrich the understanding of the integrating process of reverse cross-border M&A and the endogenous function mechanism of how knowledge diversity and managerial ability affect the promotion of EMNCs’ innovation performance. © 2022","Exploring mediating effect managerial ability knowledge diversity innovation performance reverse cross-border M&As: Evidence Chinese manufacturing corporations. increasing trend multinational corporations emerging economies (EMNCs) undertake cross-border mergers acquisitions (M&As) corporations developed economies. burgeoning pattern outward direct investment, reverse cross-border M&As enable EMNCs access technological resources conducive enhancing innovation efficiency.

These inequalities can be represented according to the Red Queen effect perspective, which has been previously hypothesized in other competitive environments (evolutionary biology and economics, for instance). The Red Queen effect considers each competitive environment to require a constant effort to maintain a position of competitive advantage in order reach the best result possible. Therefore, the aim of the current paper is to provide an innovative perspective for the understanding of competition in sports, identifying factors (i.e., physical appearance for gender equality, socioeconomic status of a sport team for technology, and antidoping rules for doping) influencing athletes’ possibilities to win a competition. Concerning gender differences, the disparity between genders reflects a lower coverage in sports news, and media are more likely to focus on female athletes’ physical appearance than their performance in sports. Therefore, women struggle more with increasing their visibility and in affirming their status as an athlete. On the other hand, the introduction of science and technological innovations in sports has generated economic interests in sport competitions, which reached superior performance levels compared to the past. Teams that cannot afford financial burdens of technological innovation risk being left out from sport competitions. Finally, doping creates a Red Queen environment since antidoping rules catch a small portion of athletes using performance enhancement drugs. © 2022 by the authors.

The nature of sports is characterized by a strong competitive component that generates inequalities among athletes at different levels, specifically in relation to gender, technology, and doping. These inequalities can be represented according to the Red Queen effect perspective, which has been previously hypothesized in other competitive environments (evolutionary biology and economics, for instance). The Red Queen effect considers each competitive environment to require a constant effort to maintain a position of competitive advantage in order reach the best result possible. Therefore, the aim of the current paper is to provide an innovative perspective for the understanding of competition in sports, identifying factors (i.e., physical appearance for gender equality, socioeconomic status of a sport team for technology, and antidoping rules for doping) influencing athletes’ possibilities to win a competition. Concerning gender differences, the disparity between genders reflects a lower coverage in sports news, and media are more likely to focus on female athletes’ physical appearance than their performance in sports. Therefore, women struggle more with increasing their visibility and in affirming their status as an athlete. On the other hand, the introduction of science and technological innovations in sports has generated economic interests in sport competitions, which reached superior performance levels compared to the past. Teams that cannot afford financial burdens of technological innovation risk being left out from sport competitions. Finally, doping creates a Red Queen environment since antidoping rules catch a small portion of athletes using performance enhancement drugs. © 2022 by the authors.

Small farms are responsible for 80% of world food production, making them key to addressing looming global food shortages (Lowder et al., 2016). Small farms in developing countries navigate a myriad of challenges, including access to information, quality inputs, capital, markets, and among others, land (FAO, 2014). These challenges can be exacerbated for women and other marginalized groups of people due to social normatives within their communities (Petesch, Badstue, & Prain, 2018; Polar et al., 2017; Rola‐Rubzen et al., 2020). Inclusive innovation to address agriculture productivity and loss gaps is tantamount to equitable global food security (FAO, 2014; FAO, 2011). However, many innovations still fail to help stimulate disruption in gender or social inequities, and some even do additional harm. Increasing use of an innovation, referred to as ‘scaling,' is critical to impact at a community or regional level, and is often seen as necessary to support Agriculture Research for Development (AR4D) outcomes (Sartas et al., 2020). Several scaling support tools and methodologies have been developed to assist researchers and practitioners in scaling processes. However, little practical attention has been given to the specific cross-section of gender and relevant diversity within scaling tools and methodologies. This narrative literature review begins to address this by answering: 1) What are unique gender considerations when scaling agricultural innovations?; and 2) What are appropriate methods and approaches for collecting data on these unique gender considerations? Our review finds six points of attention to reflect upon unique gender considerations when innovating and scaling innovation: i) Comprising research and project teams, ii) Designing agricultural innovations, iii) Communicating and extension of innovation, iv) Choosing scale models: entrepreneurship and business development, v) Reinventing and changing technology, and vi) Engaging with the political economy of innovation. Methods to collect necessary data to accurately reflect on these considerations and avoid unintended negative consequences for more gender responsible scaling are also presented. Finally, the literature review is situated in a perspective that more attention should be given to agricultural innovation and scaling support tools and methodologies to address gender or socially marginalized groups. © 2021",Appropriate technology; Gender; Innovation; Innovation systems; Responsible innovation; Scaling; Women,,"Badstue, L., Lopez, D.E., Umantseva, A., Williams, G., Elias, M., Farnworth, C.R., What drives capacity to innovate?

Of the world's 570 million farmers, 72% work on two hectares or less, and women's labor comprises at least 50% (FAO, 2014). Small farms are responsible for 80% of world food production, making them key to addressing looming global food shortages (Lowder et al., 2016). Small farms in developing countries navigate a myriad of challenges, including access to information, quality inputs, capital, markets, and among others, land (FAO, 2014). These challenges can be exacerbated for women and other marginalized groups of people due to social normatives within their communities (Petesch, Badstue, & Prain, 2018; Polar et al., 2017; Rola‐Rubzen et al., 2020). Inclusive innovation to address agriculture productivity and loss gaps is tantamount to equitable global food security (FAO, 2014; FAO, 2011). However, many innovations still fail to help stimulate disruption in gender or social inequities, and some even do additional harm. Increasing use of an innovation, referred to as ‘scaling,' is critical to impact at a community or regional level, and is often seen as necessary to support Agriculture Research for Development (AR4D) outcomes (Sartas et al., 2020). Several scaling support tools and methodologies have been developed to assist researchers and practitioners in scaling processes. However, little practical attention has been given to the specific cross-section of gender and relevant diversity within scaling tools and methodologies. This narrative literature review begins to address this by answering: 1) What are unique gender considerations when scaling agricultural innovations?; and 2) What are appropriate methods and approaches for collecting data on these unique gender considerations? Our review finds six points of attention to reflect upon unique gender considerations when innovating and scaling innovation: i) Comprising research and project teams, ii) Designing agricultural innovations, iii) Communicating and extension of innovation, iv) Choosing scale models: entrepreneurship and business development, v) Reinventing and changing technology, and vi) Engaging with the political economy of innovation. Methods to collect necessary data to accurately reflect on these considerations and avoid unintended negative consequences for more gender responsible scaling are also presented. Finally, the literature review is situated in a perspective that more attention should be given to agricultural innovation and scaling support tools and methodologies to address gender or socially marginalized groups. © 2021","Anticipating gender impacts scaling innovations agriculture: Insights literature. world's 570 million farmers, 72% work hectares less, women's labor comprises 50% (FAO, 2014).

Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical model was developed, and hypotheses were tested using step-wise multivariate regressions on survey data from 509 North American SME respondents. Findings: The results demonstrate that the previous venture experience of a firm's top management plays a key role in enhancing the innovation breadth for a given level of learning breadth. There is a curvilinear relationship between innovation breadth and learning breadth, and increases in innovation breadth lead to increases in firm performance. Practical implications: The results indicate that organizations seeking higher performance returns by expanding their breadth of innovations need parallel attention on higher learning breadth in order to adequately capture the value from this broader set of innovations. Originality/value: The paper contextualizes learning and innovation in the SMEs and argues that the consideration of diversity (breadth) of learning and innovation can help us understand their performance implications across industries. It also extends the effect of previous venture experience (PVE) of the leadership team in explaining performance. Beyond their ability to address external factors, PVE has a moderating effect on the relationship between learning and innovation breadth across the organization. Previous venture experience serves as both a guide and catalyst for investments in learning activities that lead to a broader range of innovation activities across the firm. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Innovation breadth; Learning breadth; Previous venture experience; Small and medium sized enterprises,,"Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., Reno, R.R., (1991) Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, , Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks; Akgün, A.E., Keskin, H., Byrne, J.C., Aren, S., Emotional and learning capability and their impact on product innovativeness and firm performance (2007) Technovation, 27 (9), pp. 501-513; Antonakis, J., Bendahan, S., Jacquart, P., Lalive, R., Causality and endogeneity: problems and solutions (2014) The Oxford Handbook of Leadership and Organizations, pp. 93-117. , Day, D.V.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the moderating role of previous venture experience on the relationship between learning breadth and innovation breadth, defined as the range of innovation types within a firm, and the impacts on SME performance. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical model was developed, and hypotheses were tested using step-wise multivariate regressions on survey data from 509 North American SME respondents. Findings: The results demonstrate that the previous venture experience of a firm's top management plays a key role in enhancing the innovation breadth for a given level of learning breadth. There is a curvilinear relationship between innovation breadth and learning breadth, and increases in innovation breadth lead to increases in firm performance. Practical implications: The results indicate that organizations seeking higher performance returns by expanding their breadth of innovations need parallel attention on higher learning breadth in order to adequately capture the value from this broader set of innovations. Originality/value: The paper contextualizes learning and innovation in the SMEs and argues that the consideration of diversity (breadth) of learning and innovation can help us understand their performance implications across industries. It also extends the effect of previous venture experience (PVE) of the leadership team in explaining performance. Beyond their ability to address external factors, PVE has a moderating effect on the relationship between learning and innovation breadth across the organization. Previous venture experience serves as both a guide and catalyst for investments in learning activities that lead to a broader range of innovation activities across the firm. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","moderating role previous venture experience breadth learning innovation impacts SME performance.

Evidence from the study of both Chinese firms and UK firms confirm our conceptualization by showing an interaction effect between TMT gender diversity and BOD gender diversity such that innovation is greatest when both are high. The positive TMT–BOD gender diversity interaction effect on innovation improves subsequent firm performance particularly in dynamic environments. The findings refine current thinking by going beyond research that tests intra-team TMT or BOD diversity independently and instead considers inter-team diversity across both leadership teams within the strategic leadership upper echelons. In sum, findings show that high levels of TMT and BOD gender diversity result in more organizational innovation, which ultimately improves firm performance. We offer implications for women's inclusion in leadership as well as for research on the upper echelons. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",board of directors; environmental dynamism; gender diversity; innovation; multiteam systems; top management team,adult; article; female; gender diversity; human; human experiment; leadership; male; organization; thinking,"Ahuja, G., Lampert, C.M., Entrepreneurship in the large corporation: A longitudinal study of how established firms create breakthrough inventions (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22, pp. 521-543; Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions, , Sage; Ancona, D., Caldwell, D., Demography and design: Predictors of new product team performance (1992) Organization Science, 3, pp. 321-341; Andrevski, G., Richard, O.C., Shaw, J.D., Ferrier, W.J., Racial diversity and firm performance the mediating role of competitive intensity (2014) Journal of Management, 40, pp. 820-844; Ashforth, B.E., Mael, F., Social identity theory and the organization (1989) Academy of Management Review, 14 (1), pp. 20-39; Bader, A.K., Kemper, L.E., Froese, F.J., Who promotes a value-in-diversity perspective?

Given the mixed evidence that having both women and men in the top management team (TMT) or in the board of directors (BOD) has a significant influence on organizational innovation, we resolve this issue by conceptualizing TMT–BOD gender diversity as part of a multiteam system, that has joint effects which impact organizational innovation. Evidence from the study of both Chinese firms and UK firms confirm our conceptualization by showing an interaction effect between TMT gender diversity and BOD gender diversity such that innovation is greatest when both are high. The positive TMT–BOD gender diversity interaction effect on innovation improves subsequent firm performance particularly in dynamic environments. The findings refine current thinking by going beyond research that tests intra-team TMT or BOD diversity independently and instead considers inter-team diversity across both leadership teams within the strategic leadership upper echelons. In sum, findings show that high levels of TMT and BOD gender diversity result in more organizational innovation, which ultimately improves firm performance.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors carried out an innovation survey with Brazilian manufacturing firms. A sample of 1,156 firms was analyzed in this paper. Collected data were analyzed using multivariate data analysis techniques. From an innovation capabilities approach, it was possible to identify different types of organization of the firm. Findings: Results show four different types of organization of the firm: advanced, intermediate and basic stability-oriented and change-oriented. Each type presents a different innovation capabilities arrangement. The successful strategies toward innovation are related to change-oriented organization of the firm and advanced stability-oriented organization of the firm. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to the literature by presenting a different view on the organization of the firm, encompassing the capabilities approach and thus a higher level on the perception of firms' heterogeneity. This study contributes to narrow the literature gap on how firms internally coordinate its different capabilities into a coherent organization to sustain an innovative behavior. Practical implications: These straightforward findings can serve as a guideline so that managers can conduct changes within their companies toward more innovation. Managers can reconsider its organization as a way to foment innovation, once it is identified as a key strategy for competitiveness. Social implications: This study may help managers understand that focusing on stability-driven capabilities is riskier if change-driven capabilities are not present in an adequate and aligned level of development. The outcome may be the growth of the cost structure greater than the potential return. Conversely, managers should also understand that once change-driven capabilities are in a glance, they need do follow up with stability-driven capabilities. Here, the risk is not having an adequate structure to sustain the upcoming growth, arising from innovation. In short, not only “cost and value” should be taken together, but they must be arranged following the specific situation of the company. Every company should manage costs either to sustain new added value or to allow the addition of new value. Originality/value: The study is based on a unique dataset that traces a large set of companies, being able to check different types of firm organization and associate it with innovation capabilities. The study relates to an emerging economy, which has not received adequate attention until now, largely because of the lack of micro-level data. The study is based on a robust theoretical model of innovation capabilities, which is being tested through such data.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine different types of organization of the firm considering the innovation capabilities of manufacturing firms. Design/methodology/approach: The authors carried out an innovation survey with Brazilian manufacturing firms. A sample of 1,156 firms was analyzed in this paper. Collected data were analyzed using multivariate data analysis techniques. From an innovation capabilities approach, it was possible to identify different types of organization of the firm. Findings: Results show four different types of organization of the firm: advanced, intermediate and basic stability-oriented and change-oriented. Each type presents a different innovation capabilities arrangement. The successful strategies toward innovation are related to change-oriented organization of the firm and advanced stability-oriented organization of the firm. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to the literature by presenting a different view on the organization of the firm, encompassing the capabilities approach and thus a higher level on the perception of firms' heterogeneity. This study contributes to narrow the literature gap on how firms internally coordinate its different capabilities into a coherent organization to sustain an innovative behavior. Practical implications: These straightforward findings can serve as a guideline so that managers can conduct changes within their companies toward more innovation. Managers can reconsider its organization as a way to foment innovation, once it is identified as a key strategy for competitiveness. Social implications: This study may help managers understand that focusing on stability-driven capabilities is riskier if change-driven capabilities are not present in an adequate and aligned level of development. The outcome may be the growth of the cost structure greater than the potential return. Conversely, managers should also understand that once change-driven capabilities are in a glance, they need do follow up with stability-driven capabilities. Here, the risk is not having an adequate structure to sustain the upcoming growth, arising from innovation. In short, not only “cost and value” should be taken together, but they must be arranged following the specific situation of the company. Every company should manage costs either to sustain new added value or to allow the addition of new value. Originality/value: The study is based on a unique dataset that traces a large set of companies, being able to check different types of firm organization and associate it with innovation capabilities. The study relates to an emerging economy, which has not received adequate attention until now, largely because of the lack of micro-level data. The study is based on a robust theoretical model of innovation capabilities, which is being tested through such data. Finally, results elucidate ways to improve innovation performance of firms. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Innovation capabilities organization firm: evidence Brazil.

From the perspective of upper echelons theory, This paper aims to investigate the role of top managers in gaining green competitive advantage and the intermediary effect of the green ambidexterity innovation between them. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses empirical data from heavily polluting enterprises in China for constructing a model to infer how enterprises achieve the green competitive advantage. Findings: The paper shows that (a) top managers' environmental awareness and the green ambidexterity innovation are both positively related to the green competitive advantage of enterprises, while there is a difference between the exploitative green innovation and the exploratory green innovation regarding the heterogeneity; the positive effect of the exploratory green innovation on enterprises' green competitive advantage is greater than that of the exploitative green innovation; (b) the green ambidexterity innovation plays a partial intermediary effect between top managers' environmental awareness and enterprises' green competitive advantage and (c) strategic flexibility positively moderates the relation between the green ambidexterity innovation and the green competitive advantage.

Purpose: Green ambidexterity innovation and green competitive advantage are of great significance to enterprises' sustainable development. From the perspective of upper echelons theory, This paper aims to investigate the role of top managers in gaining green competitive advantage and the intermediary effect of the green ambidexterity innovation between them. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses empirical data from heavily polluting enterprises in China for constructing a model to infer how enterprises achieve the green competitive advantage. Findings: The paper shows that (a) top managers' environmental awareness and the green ambidexterity innovation are both positively related to the green competitive advantage of enterprises, while there is a difference between the exploitative green innovation and the exploratory green innovation regarding the heterogeneity; the positive effect of the exploratory green innovation on enterprises' green competitive advantage is greater than that of the exploitative green innovation; (b) the green ambidexterity innovation plays a partial intermediary effect between top managers' environmental awareness and enterprises' green competitive advantage and (c) strategic flexibility positively moderates the relation between the green ambidexterity innovation and the green competitive advantage. The study concludes that top managers' environmental awareness has a significantly positive impact on reinforcing green competitive advantages and adopting the green ambidexterity innovation for heavily polluting enterprises in China.

However, the effect is attenuated for firms in some industries such as those that are highly competitive, those with a high level of innovation intensity, and those with high labor bargaining power. Policies emphasizing friendliness toward employees in highly competitive industries, in innovation-intensive industries, and in union-intensive industries are found to enhance firm value.

This paper explores the effect of the presence of powerful CEOs on the quality of their workplace and finds that firms with powerful CEOs invest less in labor-friendly programs and that this does not significantly affect firm value. However, the effect is attenuated for firms in some industries such as those that are highly competitive, those with a high level of innovation intensity, and those with high labor bargaining power. Policies emphasizing friendliness toward employees in highly competitive industries, in innovation-intensive industries, and in union-intensive industries are found to enhance firm value.

However, scant research has investigated how social media, as an important innovative tool within the corporate landscape, influences firm business model innovation (BMI). This paper provides an initial investigation into whether, and how, social media can be used to promote firm BMI. Drawing on the strategic capability literature, the study examines the relationship between social media strategic capability (SMSC) and BMI by focusing on the mediating role of strategic flexibility and the moderating effects of top management team (TMT) heterogeneity and environmental dynamism. Empirical results from a sample of 283 Chinese firms with two key informants each show a significant and positive association between SMSC and BMI, which is mediated by strategic flexibility. In addition, moderated path analyses indicate that TMT heterogeneity positively moderates the SMSC–strategic flexibility path, while environmental dynamism positively moderates the strategic flexibility–BMI path in the mediated relationship. Theoretical and practical implications of this study for both social media and BMI research are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Business model innovation; Environmental dynamism; Social media strategic capability; Strategic flexibility; TMT heterogeneity,,"Abdelkafi, N., Makhotin, S., Posselt, T., Business model innovations for electric mobility—what can be learned from existing business model patterns?

The rapid development of social media has significantly affected organizational innovation activities. However, scant research has investigated how social media, as an important innovative tool within the corporate landscape, influences firm business model innovation (BMI). This paper provides an initial investigation into whether, and how, social media can be used to promote firm BMI. Drawing on the strategic capability literature, the study examines the relationship between social media strategic capability (SMSC) and BMI by focusing on the mediating role of strategic flexibility and the moderating effects of top management team (TMT) heterogeneity and environmental dynamism. Empirical results from a sample of 283 Chinese firms with two key informants each show a significant and positive association between SMSC and BMI, which is mediated by strategic flexibility. In addition, moderated path analyses indicate that TMT heterogeneity positively moderates the SMSC–strategic flexibility path, while environmental dynamism positively moderates the strategic flexibility–BMI path in the mediated relationship.

Both international work experience and nationality diversity may enhance the effectiveness of geographically dispersed R&D when there is alignment between the countries of work experience and nationality of TMT members, on the one hand, and firms' R&D locations on the other. This influence is stronger for international work experience diversity than for nationality diversity, as the former provides more task-related knowledge to coordinate R&D activities and is less associated with the risk of social categorization. We find partial support for these notions in a panel analysis of the innovation performance of 165 leading MNCs based in Europe, Japan, and the United States. Managerial Summary: The international experience and nationality diversity of members of the Top Management Team (TMT) of multinational firms may facilitate the implementation of international R&D strategies. If TMT members have knowledge of local circumstances and social networks in the countries in which the firm has international R&D facilities, this can enhance the TMT's ability to allocate and coordinate international R&D tasks more effectively, and to foster firm-wide collaboration and knowledge integration. Hence, the alignment between R&D locations and the international diversity of the TMT may improve the performance effects of international R&D strategies. We find partial support for this conjecture in an analysis of the patent performance of 165 leading MNCs. It is international work experience rather than nationality diversity that brings these performance benefits. © 2020 The Authors.",diversity; innovation; internationalization; MNCs; R&D; top management teams,,"Ahuja, G., Katila, R., Where do resources come from?

Research Summary: We investigate how international diversity in Top Management Teams (TMTs) contributes to the effectiveness of geographically dispersed R&D strategies in enhancing innovation performance. Both international work experience and nationality diversity may enhance the effectiveness of geographically dispersed R&D when there is alignment between the countries of work experience and nationality of TMT members, on the one hand, and firms' R&D locations on the other. This influence is stronger for international work experience diversity than for nationality diversity, as the former provides more task-related knowledge to coordinate R&D activities and is less associated with the risk of social categorization. We find partial support for these notions in a panel analysis of the innovation performance of 165 leading MNCs based in Europe, Japan, and the United States. Managerial Summary: The international experience and nationality diversity of members of the Top Management Team (TMT) of multinational firms may facilitate the implementation of international R&D strategies. If TMT members have knowledge of local circumstances and social networks in the countries in which the firm has international R&D facilities, this can enhance the TMT's ability to allocate and coordinate international R&D tasks more effectively, and to foster firm-wide collaboration and knowledge integration. Hence, the alignment between R&D locations and the international diversity of the TMT may improve the performance effects of international R&D strategies. We find partial support for this conjecture in an analysis of the patent performance of 165 leading MNCs.

Although group diversity has been demonstrated as a predictor of employee outcomes, whether group diversity in terms of extraversion and openness enhances employee service innovative behavior remains a gap. This study aims to fill this gap by developing a multilevel model of the direct relationship between group diversity in terms of extraversion and openness and employee service innovative behavior and also the mediations and moderations behind the relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collectd data from 44 Chinese hospitality teams. The research model was validated by multilevel structural equation modeling. Findings: Results showed that both group extraversion diversity and group openness diversity fostered employee service innovative behavior via creative self-efficacy. Developmental culture strengthened the effectiveness of group openness diversity on creative self-efficacy and the effectiveness of creative self-efficacy on employee service innovative behavior. Nevertheless, developmental culture did not strengthen the effectiveness of group extraversion diversity on creative self-efficacy. Practical implications: Findings suggest that managers and team leaders from hospitality organizations can elicit employee service innovative behavior through increasing group diversity in terms of extraversion and openness. Hospitality practitioners also should understand that employees’ confidence for creativity is able to channel group diversity into employee service innovative endeavors. Moreover, building developmental culture is essential for hospitality teams to strengthen the effect of group diversity on innovating services. Originality/value: This study expands the diversity-innovation research through unfolding both the mediations and the moderations behind the link between group diversity in terms of extraversion and openness and employee service innovative behavior. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Creative self-efficacy; Developmental culture; Employee service innovative behavior; Group diversity,,"Abdi, K., Mardani, A., Senin, A.A., Tupenaite, L., Naimaviciene, J., Kanapeckiene, L., Kutut, V., The effect of knowledge management, organizational culture and organizational learning on innovation in automotive industry (2018) Journal of Business Economics and Management, 19 (1), pp. 1-19; Afsar, B., Masood, M., Transformational leadership, creative self-efficacy, trust in supervisor, uncertainty avoidance, and innovative work behavior of nurses (2018) The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, 54 (1), pp. 36-61; Al-Edenat, M., Reinforcing innovation through transformational leadership: mediating role of job satisfaction (2018) Journal of Organizational Change Management, 31 (4), pp. 810-838; Anning-Dorson, T., Innovation and competitive advantage creation: the role of organisational leadership in service firms from emerging markets (2018) International Marketing Review, 35 (4), pp. 580-600; Armstrong, J.S., Overton, T.S., Estimating nonresponse bias in mail surveys (1977) Journal of Marketing Research, 14 (3), pp. 396-402; Bagheri, A., Newman, A., Eva, N., Entrepreneurial leadership of CEOs and employees’ innovative behavior in high-technology new ventures (2020) Journal of Small Business Management, pp. 1-23; Bandura, A., A sociocognitive analysis of substance abuse: an agentic perspective (1999) Psychological Science, 10 (3), pp. 214-217; Bell, M.P., Anti-blackness, surface-level diversity continues to matter: what must we do?

Purpose: Service innovative behavior from employees helps hospitality organizations gain a competitive advantage and sustain business flourishment. Although group diversity has been demonstrated as a predictor of employee outcomes, whether group diversity in terms of extraversion and openness enhances employee service innovative behavior remains a gap. This study aims to fill this gap by developing a multilevel model of the direct relationship between group diversity in terms of extraversion and openness and employee service innovative behavior and also the mediations and moderations behind the relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collectd data from 44 Chinese hospitality teams. The research model was validated by multilevel structural equation modeling. Findings: Results showed that both group extraversion diversity and group openness diversity fostered employee service innovative behavior via creative self-efficacy. Developmental culture strengthened the effectiveness of group openness diversity on creative self-efficacy and the effectiveness of creative self-efficacy on employee service innovative behavior. Nevertheless, developmental culture did not strengthen the effectiveness of group extraversion diversity on creative self-efficacy. Practical implications: Findings suggest that managers and team leaders from hospitality organizations can elicit employee service innovative behavior through increasing group diversity in terms of extraversion and openness. Hospitality practitioners also should understand that employees’ confidence for creativity is able to channel group diversity into employee service innovative endeavors. Moreover, building developmental culture is essential for hospitality teams to strengthen the effect of group diversity on innovating services. Originality/value: This study expands the diversity-innovation research through unfolding both the mediations and the moderations behind the link between group diversity in terms of extraversion and openness and employee service innovative behavior. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Group diversity employee service innovative behavior hospitality industry: multilevel model.

Mitigating the economic concerns faced in the process of green innovation decision-making is of great significance to accelerate the process of enterprises’ green transformation. Using an unbalanced panel data of Chinese heavy pollution listed companies from 2008-2017, this paper investigates the impact of green innovation on firm value. We further test the likely channels through which green innovation can affect firm value, including the financial flexibility channel and analyst coverage channel. The study finds that: 1) increasing the proportion of green patent applications leads to the devaluation of firm value, but this devaluation effect only occurs in the short term; 2) both financial flexibility and analyst coverage partially mediate the impact of green innovation on firm value; 3) heterogeneity analysis indicates that enterprises can reduce the negative impact of green innovation on firm value by increasing the executive equity incentive and the management-employee pay gap. In addition, as economic policy uncertainty increases from low to high, the negative impact becomes smaller. Our research helps to broaden the cognitive boundaries of the economic impact of green innovation, and assists policymakers and researchers to better grasp the characteristics of green innovation behavior of enterprises in emerging economies. Finally, we provide useful enlightenments for policymakers and business managers to stimulate green innovation in enterprises.

The unspecified impact of green innovation on corporate financial performance has made some enterprises delay green innovation investment plans, and even abandon green innovation. Mitigating the economic concerns faced in the process of green innovation decision-making is of great significance to accelerate the process of enterprises’ green transformation. Using an unbalanced panel data of Chinese heavy pollution listed companies from 2008-2017, this paper investigates the impact of green innovation on firm value. We further test the likely channels through which green innovation can affect firm value, including the financial flexibility channel and analyst coverage channel. The study finds that: 1) increasing the proportion of green patent applications leads to the devaluation of firm value, but this devaluation effect only occurs in the short term; 2) both financial flexibility and analyst coverage partially mediate the impact of green innovation on firm value; 3) heterogeneity analysis indicates that enterprises can reduce the negative impact of green innovation on firm value by increasing the executive equity incentive and the management-employee pay gap. In addition, as economic policy uncertainty increases from low to high, the negative impact becomes smaller. Our research helps to broaden the cognitive boundaries of the economic impact of green innovation, and assists policymakers and researchers to better grasp the characteristics of green innovation behavior of enterprises in emerging economies. Finally, we provide useful enlightenments for policymakers and business managers to stimulate green innovation in enterprises.

Design/methodology/approach: Following the precepts of the Action Design Research (ADR) method, researchers and practitioners (teachers and consultants) collaborated in the development of the artifact. Successive versions of the artifact were tested in the field: in classrooms by the teachers and in small companies by the consultants. Findings: In addition to the artifact itself, which is available on the Internet, the lessons learned from the design process of the artifact were formalized in meta-requirements and meta-designs, in accordance with the precepts of the design theory that served as the foundation of ADR. These meta-specifications facilitate the critical analysis and evolution of the proposed artifact, in addition to the conception and proposition of new artifacts for the same class of problem. Practical implications: The dialogical nature of the ADR approach, with the development of the artifact through interactive cycles between design and use, based on the practitioners' experience of using it with the final beneficiaries, resulted in a functional artifact that is simple to use by those interested in discussing product and service innovation with small organizations. The artifact in the form of software is available to all at https://tentypescreation.com. Originality/value: From business examples and comparisons with widespread creative tactics, such as copy and invention, eight other creative tactics centered on resources available in the organization are explored by the artifact, providing means for practitioners to discuss alternative ways for managers, entrepreneurs, and future entrepreneurs to face the challenge of product and service innovation in small businesses. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Action design research; Artefact; Creative logic; Innovation; Small business,,"Adams, A., Barriers to product innovation in small firms: policy implications (1982) International Small Business Journal, 1 (1), pp. 67-86; Aguilar, S., Vengrouskie, E.F., Lloyd, R.A., Driving organizational innovation as a form of intrapreneurship within the context of small businesses (2019) Journal of Strategic Innovation and Sustainability, 14 (3), pp. 25-28; Andriani, P., Carignani, G., Modular exaptation: a missing link in the synthesis of artificial form (2014) Research Policy, 43 (9), pp. 1608-1620; Andriani, P., Ali, A.H., Mastrogiorgio, M., Measuring exaptation in the pharmaceutical industry (2015) Academy of Management Proceedings; Andriani, P., Cattani, G., Exaptation as source of creativity, innovation, and diversity: introduction to the special section (2016) Industrial and Corporate Change, 25 (1), pp. 115-131; Baskerville, R.L., Kaul, M., Storey, V.C., Genres of inquiry in design-science research: justification and evaluation of knowledge production (2015) MIS Quarterly, 39 (3), pp. 541-549; Bélanger, S., Veilleux, S., Tremblay, M., A conceptual framework on the role of creativity in sustaining continuous innovation in new product development (2016) International Journal of Product Development, 21 (2-3), pp. 190-211; Berends, H., Jelinek, M., Reymen, I., Stultiëns, R., Product innovation processes in small firms: combining entrepreneurial effectuation and managerial causation (2013) Journal of Product Innovation Management, 31 (3), pp. 616-635; Binnewies, C., Ohly, S., Sonnentag, S., Taking personal initiative and communicating about ideas: what is important for the creative process and for idea creativity?

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to make available an artifact that helps entrepreneurs and managers to recognize the diversity of creative logics centered on resources that are already available to the organization, presenting it as a tool to support the expansion of the product and service portfolio and as an alternative to Research and Development strategies, which are difficult to implement in the context of small businesses. Design/methodology/approach: Following the precepts of the Action Design Research (ADR) method, researchers and practitioners (teachers and consultants) collaborated in the development of the artifact. Successive versions of the artifact were tested in the field: in classrooms by the teachers and in small companies by the consultants. Findings: In addition to the artifact itself, which is available on the Internet, the lessons learned from the design process of the artifact were formalized in meta-requirements and meta-designs, in accordance with the precepts of the design theory that served as the foundation of ADR. These meta-specifications facilitate the critical analysis and evolution of the proposed artifact, in addition to the conception and proposition of new artifacts for the same class of problem. Practical implications: The dialogical nature of the ADR approach, with the development of the artifact through interactive cycles between design and use, based on the practitioners' experience of using it with the final beneficiaries, resulted in a functional artifact that is simple to use by those interested in discussing product and service innovation with small organizations. The artifact in the form of software is available to all at https://tentypescreation.com. Originality/value: From business examples and comparisons with widespread creative tactics, such as copy and invention, eight other creative tactics centered on resources available in the organization are explored by the artifact, providing means for practitioners to discuss alternative ways for managers, entrepreneurs, and future entrepreneurs to face the challenge of product and service innovation in small businesses. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Development products services small enterprises: proposition artifact discuss creative logics.

To achieve effective OBC, the occupancy status of a space or a building needs to be well understood in terms of whether the space is occupied and how many people are in the space. Well-designed and selected people counting technologies are cornerstones for OBC. However, the study and application of such technologies in OBC are relatively new. There are few mature people counting sensors available on the market. In addition, there is a lack of standardized guidance to comprehensively test, evaluate and compare the performance of people counting sensors, which further limits the selection and application of them in OBC. Hence, an innovative testing protocol was developed to fill in the gap. This paper introduces the design of the protocol with eight diversities and discusses case studies that evaluated four representative types of people counting sensors following the proposed protocol. It is found that the protocol can effectively guide a comprehensive evaluation of the selected sensors and lead to informative findings on the sensor performance. The test results can provide insights and suggestions not only for sensor developers to improve the sensor hardware and software design but also for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system designers and building managers to select the proper people counting sensors for OBC design. The test results on the sensor accuracy can also support additional evaluations of integrated OBC and building system operation. It is anticipated that the developed methodology can offer guidance on the test and evaluation of other occupancy sensing technologies. © 2021 The Authors",Building system; Occupancy-based control; People counting; Sensor performance,Buildings; HVAC; Software design; Software testing; Building systems; Case-studies; Evaluation protocol; Heating ventilation and air conditioning; Occupancy-based control; People counting; Sensing technology; Sensor performance; Testing and evaluation; Testing protocols; Energy efficiency; energy efficiency; innovation; multistorey building; performance assessment; technological change; technological development,"Kong, M., Semi-open Space and Micro-environmental Control for Improving Thermal Comfort, Indoor Air Quality, and Building Energy Efficiency (2017), https://surface.syr.edu/etd/, Syracuse University; Klepeis, N.E., Nelson, W.C., Ott, W.R., Robinson, J.P., Tsang, A.M., Switzer, P., Behar, J., Engelmann, W.H., The national human activity pattern survey (NHAPS): a resource for assessing exposure to environmental pollutants (2001) J.

Environ.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120449122,"Development of a testing and evaluation protocol for occupancy sensing technologies in building HVAC controls: A case study of representative people counting sensors. Occupancy-based control (OBC) in smart buildings provides numerous potentials to improve building energy efficiency. To achieve effective OBC, the occupancy status of a space or a building needs to be well understood in terms of whether the space is occupied and how many people are in the space. Well-designed and selected people counting technologies are cornerstones for OBC. However, the study and application of such technologies in OBC are relatively new. There are few mature people counting sensors available on the market. In addition, there is a lack of standardized guidance to comprehensively test, evaluate and compare the performance of people counting sensors, which further limits the selection and application of them in OBC. Hence, an innovative testing protocol was developed to fill in the gap. This paper introduces the design of the protocol with eight diversities and discusses case studies that evaluated four representative types of people counting sensors following the proposed protocol. It is found that the protocol can effectively guide a comprehensive evaluation of the selected sensors and lead to informative findings on the sensor performance. The test results can provide insights and suggestions not only for sensor developers to improve the sensor hardware and software design but also for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system designers and building managers to select the proper people counting sensors for OBC design. The test results on the sensor accuracy can also support additional evaluations of integrated OBC and building system operation. It is anticipated that the developed methodology can offer guidance on the test and evaluation of other occupancy sensing technologies. © 2021 The Authors","Development testing evaluation protocol occupancy sensing technologies building HVAC controls: case study representative people counting sensors.

The authors argue that both organizational ambidexterity and organizational innovation play a positive but differentiated role in the RKT process in that the former positively influences subsidiary knowledge creation, whereas the latter positively influences subsidiary knowledge transfers. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 289 foreign subsidiaries operating in Brazil. Hypotheses were developed and tested by applying partial least squares structural equation modeling. Findings: The results supported the hypotheses and showed that organizational ambidexterity promotes knowledge creation, and that organizational innovation facilitates knowledge transfers. Research limitations/implications: The paper offers implications with regard to drivers of subsidiary investments and actions of subsidiary managers vis-à-vis the subsidiary objectives of knowledge creation and/or transfers. Originality/value: Showing the different roles of organizational ambidexterity and organizational innovation, this paper reveals some underlying mechanisms of the RKT process and contributes by explaining the competitive heterogeneity of subsidiaries, with impacts on subsidiary management’s evolutionary and resource dependence perspective. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Foreign subsidiaries; International business; Organizational ambidexterity; Organizational innovation; Reverse knowledge transfer process,,"Achcaoucaou, F., Miravitlles, P., León-Darder, F., Knowledge sharing and subsidiary R&D mandate development: a matter of dual embeddedness (2014) International Business Review, 23 (1), pp. 76-90; Adenfelt, M., Lagerström, K., The development and sharing of knowledge by centres of excellence and transnational teams: a conceptual framework (2008) Management International Review, 48 (3), p. 319; Ambos, T.C., Birkinshaw, J., Headquarters’ attention and its effect on subsidiary performance (2010) Management International Review, 50 (4), pp. 449-469; Ambos, T.C., Andersson, U., Birkinshaw, J., What are the consequences of initiative-taking in multinational subsidiaries?

Purpose: This paper underscores how organizational ambidexterity and organizational innovation play differentiated roles in the subsidiary reverse knowledge transfers (RKT). The authors argue that both organizational ambidexterity and organizational innovation play a positive but differentiated role in the RKT process in that the former positively influences subsidiary knowledge creation, whereas the latter positively influences subsidiary knowledge transfers. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 289 foreign subsidiaries operating in Brazil. Hypotheses were developed and tested by applying partial least squares structural equation modeling. Findings: The results supported the hypotheses and showed that organizational ambidexterity promotes knowledge creation, and that organizational innovation facilitates knowledge transfers. Research limitations/implications: The paper offers implications with regard to drivers of subsidiary investments and actions of subsidiary managers vis-à-vis the subsidiary objectives of knowledge creation and/or transfers. Originality/value: Showing the different roles of organizational ambidexterity and organizational innovation, this paper reveals some underlying mechanisms of the RKT process and contributes by explaining the competitive heterogeneity of subsidiaries, with impacts on subsidiary management’s evolutionary and resource dependence perspective. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","differentiated role organizational ambidexterity organizational innovation subsidiary reverse knowledge transfer process.

The role of TMT diversity in shaping the performance of open innovation is scarcely investigated. Analysis of panel data from 150 biopharmaceutical firms in China from 2013 to 2017 reveals that the performance of two forms of open innovation (i.e. inbound and outbound) is contingent on TMT diversity. In addition, a differential moderating effect occurs when TMT diversity emerges from distinct attributes of the members, namely, surface-level (e.g. gender and age) and deep-level (e.g. functional background). The results contribute to studies on upper echelons theory and open innovation strategy. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",deep-level; inbound; outbound; surface-level; TMT diversity,,"Ahn, J.M., Minshall, T., Mortara, L., Understanding the Human Side of Openness: The fit between Open Innovation Modes and CEO Characteristics (2017) R&D Management, 47 (5), pp. 727-740; Allison, P.D., Measures of Inequality (1978) American Sociological Review, 43 (6), pp. 865-880; Amason, A.C., Distinguishing the Effects of Functional and Dysfunctional Conflict on Strategic Decision Making: Resolving a Paradox for Top Management Teams (1996) Academy of Management Journal, 39 (1), pp. 123-148; Bantel, K.A., Jackson, S.E., Top Management and Innovations in Banking: Does the Composition of the top Team Make a Difference?

However, small firms may not be able to keep these workers. We study how the knowledge-skill complementarity relates to job duration in small and large firms, using a Portuguese linked employer-employee data set. We select workers displaced by firm closure and estimate a discrete-time hazard model with unobserved heterogeneity on the subsequent job relationship. To account for the initial sorting of displaced workers to firms, we introduce weights in the model according to the individual propensity of employment in a small firm. Our results show a lower premium on skills in terms of job duration for small firms. Furthermore, we find evidence of a strong knowledge-skill complementarity in large firms, where the accumulation of firm-specific human capital also plays a more important role in determining the hazard of job separation. For small firms, the complementarity does not translate into longer job duration, even for those with pay policies above the market. Overall, small knowledge-intensive firms struggle to retain high skill workers and find it harder to leverage the knowledge-skill complementarity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Firm size; Job duration; Knowledge intensity; Skills; Small firms; Technology,,"Abowd, J.M., Kramarz, F., Margolis, D.N., High Wage Workers and High Wage Firms (1999) Econometrica, 67 (2), pp. 251-333; Daron, A., Autor, D., Skills, Tasks and Technologies: Implications for Employment and Earnings.” (2011) Handbook of Labor Economics, Edited by David E.

In the knowledge economy, skilled workers play an important role in innovation and economic growth. However, small firms may not be able to keep these workers. We study how the knowledge-skill complementarity relates to job duration in small and large firms, using a Portuguese linked employer-employee data set. We select workers displaced by firm closure and estimate a discrete-time hazard model with unobserved heterogeneity on the subsequent job relationship. To account for the initial sorting of displaced workers to firms, we introduce weights in the model according to the individual propensity of employment in a small firm. Our results show a lower premium on skills in terms of job duration for small firms. Furthermore, we find evidence of a strong knowledge-skill complementarity in large firms, where the accumulation of firm-specific human capital also plays a more important role in determining the hazard of job separation. For small firms, the complementarity does not translate into longer job duration, even for those with pay policies above the market. Overall, small knowledge-intensive firms struggle to retain high skill workers and find it harder to leverage the knowledge-skill complementarity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","struggle small firms retain high-skill workers: job duration importance knowledge intensity. knowledge economy, skilled workers play important role innovation economic growth.

This study critiques essentialist ‘Input-Process-Output’ logics to focus on team members’ sensemaking. Using observation and interview data from an ethnographic study of an Indian-German team over an 18-month high-pressure project, we used thematic analysis and event sequencing to map sensemaking of culture and performance over time. Team members initially constructed a prospective frame linking stereotypes of cultural difference to performance, which plausibly explained problems while protecting identity. This frame proved resistant to updating. While overt conflict was avoided, the failure to confront difficulties closed down alternative explanations and prevented innovation and learning. Team performance was evaluated both positively and negatively reflecting ongoing ambiguity around performance. The role of culture in performance was only challenged post-project after time for reflection. The longitudinal, ethnographic approach enables this research to contribute to sensemaking by demonstrating the importance of prospective framing and highlighting the role of identity and plausibility in resisting updating frames. We argue that essentialist conceptions of the unequivocal positive or negative outcome of cultural diversity as ‘double-edged sword’ should be reframed to stress agency and the importance of facilitating conditions for learning in multicultural teams. © The Author(s) 2022.",Culture; ethnography; learning; multicultural teams; performance; sensemaking,,"Adams, G., Dobles, I., Gomez, L., Decolonizing psychological science: Introduction to the special thematic section (2015) Journal of Social and Political Psychology, 3 (1), pp. 213-238; Ailon-Souday, G., Kunda, G., The local selves of global workers: The social construction of national identity in the face of organizational globalization (2003) Organization Studies, 24 (7), pp. 1073-1096; Barinaga, E., ‘Cultural diversity’ at work: ‘National culture’ as a discourse organizing an international project group (2007) Human Relations, 60 (2), pp. 315-340; Berry, J.W., Poortinga, Y.H., Segall, M.H., (2002) Cross Cultural Psychology Research and Applications, , 2nd edn., Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Boussebaa, M., From cultural differences to cultural globalization: towards a new research agenda in cross-cultural management studies (2021) Critical Perspectives on International Business, 17 (3), pp. 381-398; Boyatzis, R.E., (1998) Transforming Qualitative Information: Thematic Analysis and Code Development, , Thousand Oaks, CA, SAGE; Brown, A.D., Colville, I., Pye, A., Making sense of sensemaking in organization studies (2015) Organization Studies, 36 (2), pp. 265-277; Brown, A.D., Stacey, P., Nandhakumar, J., Making sense of sensemaking narratives (2008) Human Relations, 61 (8), pp. 1035-1062; Christianson, M.K., More and less effective updating: The role of trajectory management in making sense again (2019) Administrative Science Quarterly, 64 (1), pp. 45-86; Colville, I., Hennestad, B., Thoner, K., Organizing, changing and learning: A sensemaking perspective on an ongoing ‘soap story’ (2014) Management Learning, 45 (2), pp. 216-234; Colville, I., Pye, A., Brown, A.D., Sensemaking processes and Weickarious learning (2016) Management Learning, 47 (1), pp. 3-13; Cornelissen, J.P., Mantere, S., Vaara, E., The contraction of meaning: The combined effect of communication, emotions, and materiality on sensemaking in the Stockwell shooting (2014) Journal of Management Studies, 51 (5), pp. 699-736; Cramton, C.D., Hinds, P.J., An embedded model of cultural adaptation in global teams (2014) Organization Science, 25 (4), pp. 1056-1081; Cramton, C.D., Köhler, T., Levitt, R.E., Using scripts to address cultural and institutional challenges of global project coordination (2021) Journal of International Business Studies, 52 (1), pp. 56-77; Cunliffe, A.L., Orientations to social constructionism: Relationally responsive social constructionism and its implications for knowledge and learning (2008) Management Learning, 39 (2), pp. 123-139; Earley, P.C., Ang, S., (2003) Cultural Intelligence: Individual Interactions across Cultures, , Stanford, CA, Stanford University Press; Earley, P.C., Gibson, C.B., (2002) Multinational Work Teams: A New Perspective, , Mahwah, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates; Earley, P.C., Mosakowski, E., Creating hybrid team cultures: An empirical test of transnational team functioning (2000) Academy of Management Journal, 43 (1), pp. 26-50; Einola, K., Alvesson, M., The making and unmaking of teams (2019) Human Relations, 72 (12), pp. 1891-1919; Fellows, R., Liu, A., Sensemaking in the cross-cultural contexts of projects (2016) International Journal of Project Management, 34 (2), pp. 246-257; Gagnon, S., Collinson, D., Resistance through difference: The co-constitution of dissent and inclusion (2017) Organization Studies, 38 (9), pp. 1253-1276; Hackman, J., The psychology of self-management in organisations (1986) The Master Lectures, Vol. 5.

Links between cultural diversity and team performance remain unclear despite extensive research. This study critiques essentialist ‘Input-Process-Output’ logics to focus on team members’ sensemaking. Using observation and interview data from an ethnographic study of an Indian-German team over an 18-month high-pressure project, we used thematic analysis and event sequencing to map sensemaking of culture and performance over time. Team members initially constructed a prospective frame linking stereotypes of cultural difference to performance, which plausibly explained problems while protecting identity. This frame proved resistant to updating. While overt conflict was avoided, the failure to confront difficulties closed down alternative explanations and prevented innovation and learning. Team performance was evaluated both positively and negatively reflecting ongoing ambiguity around performance. The role of culture in performance was only challenged post-project after time for reflection. The longitudinal, ethnographic approach enables this research to contribute to sensemaking by demonstrating the importance of prospective framing and highlighting the role of identity and plausibility in resisting updating frames. We argue that essentialist conceptions of the unequivocal positive or negative outcome of cultural diversity as ‘double-edged sword’ should be reframed to stress agency and the importance of facilitating conditions for learning in multicultural teams. © The Author(s) 2022.","‘Maybe it’s culture maybe isn’t’: ethnographic study sensemaking, culture performance multicultural team.

We examine this location-strategy interplay through a structure-agency perspective by investigating how the economic landscape shapes and, simultaneously, is shaped by firm strategies. Increasing spatial disparity and diversity of innovation and wealth in clusters and city-regions create both tremendous challenges and opportunities for multinational enterprises to strategically leverage knowledge over space. Locational choices and actions of multinationals, in turn, affect regional economic development paths and geographies of innovation. We argue for deep dialogue and collaboration between economic geography, international business and strategy to untie the knots in the intricate interplay between location and strategy and solve the grand challenges in our turbulent age. Managerial Summary: The wide spread of protectionism and the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted global value chains unprecedently, forcing policymakers and firm managers to rethink the relationship between business strategies and locations. We suggest that this relationship can be understood in a bilateral way. The concentration of innovation and economic activities in city-regions and clusters creates big challenges but also tremendous opportunities for multinational enterprises. Multinationals need to direct knowledge across space but also have to deal with local resistance and opposition. The choices and actions of these firms are shaped by and, simultaneously, influence spatial patterns of economic activities. We argue for deep collaboration between economic geographers and international business scholars to solve the grand challenges for business, community and society in our turbulent time. © 2022 Strategic Management Society.",city-regions; clusters; location; spatial inequality; strategy,,"Alcácer, J., Chung, W.J., Benefiting from location: knowledge seeking (2011) Global Strategy Journal, 1, pp. 132-134; Alcácer, J., Chung, W.J., Location strategies for agglomeration economies (2014) Strategic Management Journal, 35, pp. 1749-1761; Alcácer, J., Dezső, C., Zhao, M., Firm rivalry, knowledge accumulation, and MNE location choices (2013) Journal of International Business Studies, 44, pp. 504-520; Alcácer, J., Kogut, B., Thomas, C., Yeung, B., Geography, location, and strategy (2017) Geography, Location, and Strategy, pp. 1-6. , J.

Research Summary: The spread of protectionist policies and the COVID-19 pandemic force policymakers and managers to fundamentally rethink the relationship between location and strategy. We examine this location-strategy interplay through a structure-agency perspective by investigating how the economic landscape shapes and, simultaneously, is shaped by firm strategies. Increasing spatial disparity and diversity of innovation and wealth in clusters and city-regions create both tremendous challenges and opportunities for multinational enterprises to strategically leverage knowledge over space. Locational choices and actions of multinationals, in turn, affect regional economic development paths and geographies of innovation. We argue for deep dialogue and collaboration between economic geography, international business and strategy to untie the knots in the intricate interplay between location and strategy and solve the grand challenges in our turbulent age. Managerial Summary: The wide spread of protectionism and the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted global value chains unprecedently, forcing policymakers and firm managers to rethink the relationship between business strategies and locations. We suggest that this relationship can be understood in a bilateral way. The concentration of innovation and economic activities in city-regions and clusters creates big challenges but also tremendous opportunities for multinational enterprises. Multinationals need to direct knowledge across space but also have to deal with local resistance and opposition.

Data was collected using an online structured questionnaire and interview protocol. The nine informants and 71 respondents worked at various job positions with multi-national companies based in Thailand. The 71 respondents were selected using non-probability random sampling, while purposive sampling was used to identify the nine informants. The quantitative data analysis utilized Pearson Correlation, Paired Sample T-test, and Priority Needs Index Modified (PNI mod), while the qualitative data analysis of the interview data utilized content analysis. The quantitative findings revealed significant relationships between the variables (p < 0.01). Results of the paired sample statistics revealed that only the paired samples of workplace inclusion and psychological safety obtained a significant mean difference, with significance values of.005 and.001, respectively, while the order of priority needs of the constructs showed psychological safety, workplace inclusion, perceived organizational support, innovation in the workplace, and self-efficacy, to have the respective order of priority. The qualitative data analysis resulted in three themes consisting of diversity, inclusive culture, and inclusive management. The research findings were used to design the model entitled “Co-creative Organization Inclusion” with three components, namely Component 1: Co-creative organization inclusion through representation that leverages individual & team potential; Component 2: Co-creative organizational inclusion by top-management championing representation; and Component 3: Co-creative organization inclusion through a supportive and collaborative culture. © 2022.

Drawing on upper echelons theory, we examine directors' gender in conjunction with family affiliation to investigate the influence of family female directors on family SMEs' innovation. Moreover, by analyzing the contingent role of socioemotional wealth preferences, we open the black box of noneconomic aspects shaping the cognition and behavior of boards. Our analysis of a unique survey-based sample of 287 Belgian family SMEs reveals that family female directors do exert a positive influence on R&D intensity. However, according to the mixed gamble logic, this influence is filtered by the positive and negative moderation of their socioemotional wealth preferences. Managerial Summary: We examine the role that women who are members of the family owning a business play in the decision making of SMEs. Specifically, we investigate the influence that the involvement of family female directors in the board of family SMEs exerts on innovation decisions. To empirically address this line of inquiry, we conducted a survey on 287 Belgian family SMEs. Our analysis shows that the involvement of family female directors in the board fosters family SME's innovation investments. Yet, such an influence is weakened by the intention of the family to retain control over the business but is enhanced by the identification of family members with the firm and by the desire to renew family bonds through dynastic succession. Therefore, our study cautions family SMEs' owners and managers to pay attention to these important dimensions of diversity when appointing directors to their board. © 2022 Strategic Management Society.",innovation; mixed gamble; socioemotional wealth; upper echelons; women,,"Alessandri, T.M., Cerrato, D., Eddleston, K.A., The mixed gamble of internationalization in family and nonfamily firms: The moderating role of organizational slack (2018) Global Strategy Journal, 8 (1), pp. 46-72; Ali, M., Ng, Y.L., Kulik, C.T., Board age and gender diversity: A test of competing linear and curvilinear predictions (2014) Journal of Business Ethics, 125 (3), pp. 497-512; Amore, M.D., Garofalo, O., Minichilli, A., Gender interactions within the family firm (2014) Management Science, 60 (5), pp. 1083-1087; Arena, C., Michelon, G., Trojanowski, G., Big egos can be green: A study of CEO hubris and environmental innovation (2018) British Journal of Management, 29 (2), pp. 316-336; Arzubiaga, U., Kotlar, J., De Massis, A., Maseda, A., Iturralde, T., Entrepreneurial orientation and innovation in family SMEs: Unveiling the (actual) impact of the Board of Directors (2018) Journal of Business Venturing, 33 (4), pp. 455-469; Ashwin, A.S., Krishnan, R.T., George, R., Family firms in India: Family involvement, innovation and agency and stewardship behaviors (2015) Journal of Management, 32 (4), pp. 869-900; Bagshaw, M., Is diversity divisive?

Research Summary: While family small and medium enterprises (SMEs) increasingly involve women in their boards, the role of female directors as catalysts of innovation is yet to be fully understood. Drawing on upper echelons theory, we examine directors' gender in conjunction with family affiliation to investigate the influence of family female directors on family SMEs' innovation. Moreover, by analyzing the contingent role of socioemotional wealth preferences, we open the black box of noneconomic aspects shaping the cognition and behavior of boards. Our analysis of a unique survey-based sample of 287 Belgian family SMEs reveals that family female directors do exert a positive influence on R&D intensity. However, according to the mixed gamble logic, this influence is filtered by the positive and negative moderation of their socioemotional wealth preferences. Managerial Summary: We examine the role that women who are members of the family owning a business play in the decision making of SMEs. Specifically, we investigate the influence that the involvement of family female directors in the board of family SMEs exerts on innovation decisions. To empirically address this line of inquiry, we conducted a survey on 287 Belgian family SMEs. Our analysis shows that the involvement of family female directors in the board fosters family SME's innovation investments. Yet, such an influence is weakened by the intention of the family to retain control over the business but is enhanced by the identification of family members with the firm and by the desire to renew family bonds through dynastic succession. Therefore, our study cautions family SMEs' owners and managers to pay attention to these important dimensions of diversity when appointing directors to their board. © 2022 Strategic Management Society.","family female directors catalysts innovation family small medium enterprises?.

Building on the model of collaborative creativity and innovation and synthesizing findings from published and unpublished studies, this meta-analysis examines the role of team design on team creativity and innovation. We used random-effects meta-analysis to cumulate the correlations between different features of team design and team creativity or team innovation from 134 field studies representing 11,353 teams and 35 studies representing 2,485 student teams. We found that team tenure is curvilinearly related, autonomy-supportive leadership, task interdependence, and goal interdependence are positively related, and demographic diversity and team size are unrelated to team creativity and innovation. Examining meta-analytic path models, we found that task interdependence and supportive leadership positively relate to team creativity and innovation via team collaboration and team potency. In accounting for the literature, we found a dearth of studies examining team processes, some types of diversity such as racial diversity, and the role of team member turnover. We conclude by providing directions for future research and practical guidance about increasing team creativity and innovation through team design. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",leadership; meta-analysis; team composition; team creativity; team design; team innovation,,"Aguinis, H., Sturman, M.C., Pierce, C.A., Comparison of three meta-analytic procedures for estimating moderating effects of categorical variables (2008) Organizational Research Methods, 11, pp. 9-34. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428106292896; Amabile, T.M., Motivational synergy: Toward new conceptualizations of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in the workplace (1993) Human Resource Management Review, 3, pp. 185-201. , https://doi.org/10.1016/1053-4822(93)90012-S; Amabile, T.M., Pratt, M.G., The dynamic componential model of creativity and innovation in organizations: Making progress, making meaning (2016) Research in Organizational Behavior, 36, pp. 157-183. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.riob.2016.10.001; Amason, A.C., Sapienza, H.J., The effects of top management team size and interaction norms on cognitive and affective conflict (1997) Journal of Management, 23, pp. 495-516. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S0149-2063(97)90045-3; Ancona, D.G., Caldwell, D.F., Bridging the boundary: External activity and performance in organizational teams (1992) Administrative Science Quarterly, 37, pp. 634-665. , https://doi.org/10.2307/2393475; Ancona, D.G., Caldwell, D.F., Demography and design: Predictors of new product team performance (1992) Organization Science, 3, pp. 321-341. , https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.3.3.321; Anderson, N., De Dreu, C.K., Nijstad, B.A., The routinization of innovation research: A constructively critical review of the state-of-the-science (2004) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 25, pp. 147-173. , https://doi.org/10.1002/job.236; Anderson, N., Potočnik, K., Zhou, J., Innovation and creativity in organizations: A state-of-the-science review, prospective commentary, and guiding framework (2014) Journal of Management, 40, pp. 1297-1333. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0149206314527128; Anderson, N.R., West, M.A., Measuring climate for work group innovation: Development and validation of the team climate inventory (1998) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 19 (3), pp. 235-258; Aytug, Z.G., Rothstein, H.R., Zhou, W., Kern, M.C., Revealed or concealed?

Although organizations increasingly rely on teams to innovate, little systematic knowledge exists about how to design teams to do so. Building on the model of collaborative creativity and innovation and synthesizing findings from published and unpublished studies, this meta-analysis examines the role of team design on team creativity and innovation. We used random-effects meta-analysis to cumulate the correlations between different features of team design and team creativity or team innovation from 134 field studies representing 11,353 teams and 35 studies representing 2,485 student teams. We found that team tenure is curvilinearly related, autonomy-supportive leadership, task interdependence, and goal interdependence are positively related, and demographic diversity and team size are unrelated to team creativity and innovation. Examining meta-analytic path models, we found that task interdependence and supportive leadership positively relate to team creativity and innovation via team collaboration and team potency. In accounting for the literature, we found a dearth of studies examining team processes, some types of diversity such as racial diversity, and the role of team member turnover. We conclude by providing directions for future research and practical guidance about increasing team creativity and innovation through team design. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Building blocks idea generation implementation teams: meta-analysis team design team creativity innovation. organizations increasingly rely teams innovate, little systematic knowledge exists design teams so.

Building upon the capability and social network literature, we contend that firms’ technological capability and network position within industry alliances determine the optimal balance between exploration and exploitation. Analysing 7-year panel data in the worldwide semiconductor industry from 1994 to 2000, we find support for the following hypotheses: 1) the proportion of exploration has an inverted U-shaped relationship with innovation performance; 2) as firm technological capability increases, the optimal point between exploration and exploitation moves towards the exploration side; 3) as network centrality within industry alliances increases, the optimal point moves towards the exploitation side. The results offer theoretical insights into the ambidexterity literature as well as managerial implications for firms making resource allocation decisions. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Ambidexterity; exploration and exploitation; industry alliance network; technological capability,,"Adams, P., Fontana, R., Malerba, F., The Magnitude of Innovation by Demand in a Sectoral System: The Role of Industrial Users in Semiconductors (2013) Research Policy, 42 (1), pp. 1-14; Ahuja, G., Katila, R., Technological Acquisitions and the Innovation Performance of Acquiring Firms: A Longitudinal Study (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22 (3), pp. 197-220; Alcácer, J., Chung, W., Location Strategies and Knowledge Spillovers (2007) Management Science, 53 (5), pp. 760-776; Almeida, P., Knowledge Sourcing by Foreign Multinationals: Patent Citation Analysis in the US Semiconductor Industry (1996) Strategic Management Journal, 17 (S2), pp. 155-165; Bae, J., Gargiulo, M., Partner Substitutability, Alliance Network Structure, and Firm Profitability in the Telecommunications Industry (2004) Academy of Management Journal, 47 (6), pp. 843-859; Barabasi, A., Albert, R., Emergence of Scaling in Random Networks (1999) Science, 286 (5439), pp. 509-512; Baum, J.A., Shipilov, A.V., Rowley, T.J., Where Do Small Worlds Come From?

The major issue for academia and industry is to overcome these challenges quickly and optimally to improve the invulnerability of innovation networks. Previous research has investigated static network invulnerability caused by network governance, macro-structural attributes, core corporate governance, and cascading failure. However, two gaps on this topic need to be filled in this research. First, the dynamic evolution of the innovation network and its micro-dynamic foundation are ignored. Second, sufficient explanation from the mesoscopic cohesive subgroup is lacking. It is important to fill these gaps as the industrial innovation network is a dynamically evolving organization. The micro-dynamic behavior of network actors is the most fundamental factor affecting network outcomes. Conducting micro-foundations explains how lower-level actors and their interactions affect the outcomes at a higher level. Moreover, the cohesive subgroup is the intermediate form of the transformation from the micro to the macro level, playing a significant role in the dynamic establishment of micro-network members and macro innovation networks. Based on these considerations, this study seeks to address the following three questions. First, how does the membership variation of technology clusters influence innovation network invulnerability? Second, what role does the knowledge flow coupling between technology clusters play in the relationship? Third, is membership variation effective for reinforcing the knowledge flow coupling of technology clusters in the case of technological heterogeneity contingency? This study enhances existing research in the following three aspects. First, it contributes to the structural changes and the knowledge diffusion in the formation, merger, division, or disintegration of technology clusters caused by member variation, expanding the research on the dynamic properties of network communities. Second, it extends the understanding of technology clusters to the entire innovation network and analyzes the nonlinear mechanism of the coupling activity of technology clusters, the antecedent variable, on the invulnerability of innovation networks. Third, based on the global network perspective, this study constructs a cross-hierarchy analysis paradigm of “ micro-dynamic behavior of members-medium technology clusters' interaction-macro network outcome” and explains how the member variation improves innovation network invulnerability. Finally, this study extends technological heterogeneity as a situational variable to this research framework, deepening the understanding of the path in the first half of the mediating effects. We predict that technology cluster coupling plays a nonlinear mediating role in the relationship between membership variation and the invulnerability of industrial innovation networks. Moreover, inter-cluster technological heterogeneity positively moderates the positive effect of the rate of change of membership variation on technology cluster coupling. To test the hypotheses, we used the 11 main technological fields of the new energy industry as the research sample and constructed 138 patent citation networks as our analytical unit. Further, we identified technology clusters based on the block model and performed network topology and hierarchical regression analyses. The results show that membership variation positively affects the coupling of technology clusters and presents an inverted U-shaped influence on the invulnerability of the industrial innovation network. The inter-cluster technological heterogeneity positively moderates the first half path of the mediating effect. This research provides the following insights for industrial innovation network managers and regulators. First, it guides the construction of technology clusters and manages their interaction activities from micro-network members' innovation behavior by understanding the dynamic behavior of the organization clustering. Second, it advocates that enterprise should focus on the disadvantages of “circle thinking” and organize technology clusters to enable appropriate innovation interactions to promote innovation networks. Third, from the global perspective of innovation network governance, it is necessary to establish a flexible configuration mechanism for cluster members and maintain the destructiveness of the innovation network of the new energy industry through appropriate coupling between technology clusters.

Management,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123259720,"Relationship between membership variation and knowledge coupling of technology clusters and industrial innovation network invulnerability: role of technological heterogeneity. Industrial innovation networks are vulnerable to uncertainty or risks posed by factors such as the dynamic industrial environment, disruptive technologies, and extruded product production cycles during the innovation process. The major issue for academia and industry is to overcome these challenges quickly and optimally to improve the invulnerability of innovation networks. Previous research has investigated static network invulnerability caused by network governance, macro-structural attributes, core corporate governance, and cascading failure. However, two gaps on this topic need to be filled in this research. First, the dynamic evolution of the innovation network and its micro-dynamic foundation are ignored. Second, sufficient explanation from the mesoscopic cohesive subgroup is lacking. It is important to fill these gaps as the industrial innovation network is a dynamically evolving organization. The micro-dynamic behavior of network actors is the most fundamental factor affecting network outcomes. Conducting micro-foundations explains how lower-level actors and their interactions affect the outcomes at a higher level. Moreover, the cohesive subgroup is the intermediate form of the transformation from the micro to the macro level, playing a significant role in the dynamic establishment of micro-network members and macro innovation networks. Based on these considerations, this study seeks to address the following three questions. First, how does the membership variation of technology clusters influence innovation network invulnerability? Second, what role does the knowledge flow coupling between technology clusters play in the relationship? Third, is membership variation effective for reinforcing the knowledge flow coupling of technology clusters in the case of technological heterogeneity contingency? This study enhances existing research in the following three aspects. First, it contributes to the structural changes and the knowledge diffusion in the formation, merger, division, or disintegration of technology clusters caused by member variation, expanding the research on the dynamic properties of network communities. Second, it extends the understanding of technology clusters to the entire innovation network and analyzes the nonlinear mechanism of the coupling activity of technology clusters, the antecedent variable, on the invulnerability of innovation networks. Third, based on the global network perspective, this study constructs a cross-hierarchy analysis paradigm of “ micro-dynamic behavior of members-medium technology clusters' interaction-macro network outcome” and explains how the member variation improves innovation network invulnerability. Finally, this study extends technological heterogeneity as a situational variable to this research framework, deepening the understanding of the path in the first half of the mediating effects. We predict that technology cluster coupling plays a nonlinear mediating role in the relationship between membership variation and the invulnerability of industrial innovation networks. Moreover, inter-cluster technological heterogeneity positively moderates the positive effect of the rate of change of membership variation on technology cluster coupling. To test the hypotheses, we used the 11 main technological fields of the new energy industry as the research sample and constructed 138 patent citation networks as our analytical unit. Further, we identified technology clusters based on the block model and performed network topology and hierarchical regression analyses. The results show that membership variation positively affects the coupling of technology clusters and presents an inverted U-shaped influence on the invulnerability of the industrial innovation network. The inter-cluster technological heterogeneity positively moderates the first half path of the mediating effect. This research provides the following insights for industrial innovation network managers and regulators. First, it guides the construction of technology clusters and manages their interaction activities from micro-network members' innovation behavior by understanding the dynamic behavior of the organization clustering. Second, it advocates that enterprise should focus on the disadvantages of “circle thinking” and organize technology clusters to enable appropriate innovation interactions to promote innovation networks. Third, from the global perspective of innovation network governance, it is necessary to establish a flexible configuration mechanism for cluster members and maintain the destructiveness of the innovation network of the new energy industry through appropriate coupling between technology clusters. Fourth, when the technological differences between technology clusters are large, they should be encouraged to frequently enter and exit the clusters' boundaries to promote the formation of multidimensional and circulating channels of technology diffusion, improving the stable operation of the innovation network. © 2022.

Based on women’s participation in decision-making and family firm literature, we argue that women directors/executives’ impact on decision-making will rely on their relative power and credibility within the board. These dynamics are especially crucial, bringing creativity to family firm’s boardrooms as well. The results show that increases in innovation and creativity with women’s presence in family firms’ boards are due mainly to outsider non-family and insider family women directors/executives. Even after the division of women directors into independent and non-independent directors, the finding suggests that women independent directors have an impact on the company’s innovations. Conversely, women chair minimal effects on the innovation and creativity advances of the businesses.

This article aims to understand better the impact of the diversity of gender in boards on the innovation and creativity of companies in the context of the structure of business—family businesses and non-family businesses. Based on women’s participation in decision-making and family firm literature, we argue that women directors/executives’ impact on decision-making will rely on their relative power and credibility within the board. These dynamics are especially crucial, bringing creativity to family firm’s boardrooms as well. The results show that increases in innovation and creativity with women’s presence in family firms’ boards are due mainly to outsider non-family and insider family women directors/executives. Even after the division of women directors into independent and non-independent directors, the finding suggests that women independent directors have an impact on the company’s innovations. Conversely, women chair minimal effects on the innovation and creativity advances of the businesses.

Collective intelligence means when a group of people do things that seem intelligent. On the other hand, when intelligent people are gathered or hired in an organization, they tend toward collective stupidity and slow-wittedness. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to develop a model of the factors affecting and affected by collective stupidity. Design/methodology/approach: This study was conducted using a mixed-method approach and in two phases: qualitative and quantitative. First, in the qualitative phase and in order to achieve new findings, semi-structured interviews with experts from 12 knowledge-based companies were used to design a conceptual model and formulate the hypotheses. At the end of the qualitative phase, the conceptual model and relationships between variables were drawn. Then, in the quantitative phase, by running structural equation modeling, the antecedents and consequences of collective stupidity derived from the qualitative phase findings were analyzed and the research hypotheses were tested in 110 industrial knowledge-based companies. Findings: The results of the qualitative phase revealed that individual, group and organizational factors were the antecedents of collective stupidity, with individual factors having three dimensions, collective ones including two dimensions and organizational ones focusing on the characteristics of managers/companies. It was also found that collective stupidity had individual consequences in three dimensions and organizational consequences in five dimensions; and one-sidedness, non-strategic thinking, organizational injustice and weakness in the management of key personnel were extracted as mediators. The results of the quantitative phase confirmed the research model and showed that individual factors and organizational consequences had the lowest (0.037) and highest (1.084) effect sizes on collective stupidity, respectively. Research limitations/implications: The study of the phenomenon in a particular context and the difficulty of generalizing the findings to other situations, the small size of the study population due to the disproportionate number of experts to the total staff in the qualitative phase, and the limited participation of experts due to the negative nature of the issue in the quantitative phase. Taking advantage of the diversity of experts' mental abilities through equipping the organization with tools for recognizing collective stupidity, improving collective decision-making, enhancing the efficiency of think tanks and organizational prosperity in the age of knowledge economy, preventing damage to the body of knowledge of the company and reducing social loafing can be the main operational implications of this study. Originality/value: Using a mixed-method approach for analyzing the antecedents and consequences of collective stupidity in this study and examining such a phenomenon in a knowledge-based organizational context and its implementation in a developing country can be among the innovations of the present research. By following a few studies conducted in this field in addition to the organizational pathology of the phenomenon using a fundamental method, this study obtained deep results on how to make the maximum use of experts’ capacities.

Decis.,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122851666,"Collective stupidity: influences on decision-making in knowledge-based companies. Purpose: Even the smartest organizations believe that “good enough is never good enough.” Highly intelligent people may be able to do important things individually; still, it is their accumulated brainpower that allows them to do great things. Collective intelligence means when a group of people do things that seem intelligent. On the other hand, when intelligent people are gathered or hired in an organization, they tend toward collective stupidity and slow-wittedness. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to develop a model of the factors affecting and affected by collective stupidity. Design/methodology/approach: This study was conducted using a mixed-method approach and in two phases: qualitative and quantitative. First, in the qualitative phase and in order to achieve new findings, semi-structured interviews with experts from 12 knowledge-based companies were used to design a conceptual model and formulate the hypotheses. At the end of the qualitative phase, the conceptual model and relationships between variables were drawn. Then, in the quantitative phase, by running structural equation modeling, the antecedents and consequences of collective stupidity derived from the qualitative phase findings were analyzed and the research hypotheses were tested in 110 industrial knowledge-based companies. Findings: The results of the qualitative phase revealed that individual, group and organizational factors were the antecedents of collective stupidity, with individual factors having three dimensions, collective ones including two dimensions and organizational ones focusing on the characteristics of managers/companies. It was also found that collective stupidity had individual consequences in three dimensions and organizational consequences in five dimensions; and one-sidedness, non-strategic thinking, organizational injustice and weakness in the management of key personnel were extracted as mediators. The results of the quantitative phase confirmed the research model and showed that individual factors and organizational consequences had the lowest (0.037) and highest (1.084) effect sizes on collective stupidity, respectively. Research limitations/implications: The study of the phenomenon in a particular context and the difficulty of generalizing the findings to other situations, the small size of the study population due to the disproportionate number of experts to the total staff in the qualitative phase, and the limited participation of experts due to the negative nature of the issue in the quantitative phase. Taking advantage of the diversity of experts' mental abilities through equipping the organization with tools for recognizing collective stupidity, improving collective decision-making, enhancing the efficiency of think tanks and organizational prosperity in the age of knowledge economy, preventing damage to the body of knowledge of the company and reducing social loafing can be the main operational implications of this study. Originality/value: Using a mixed-method approach for analyzing the antecedents and consequences of collective stupidity in this study and examining such a phenomenon in a knowledge-based organizational context and its implementation in a developing country can be among the innovations of the present research. By following a few studies conducted in this field in addition to the organizational pathology of the phenomenon using a fundamental method, this study obtained deep results on how to make the maximum use of experts’ capacities. This was to the extent that in all of the three sections, i.e. the antecedents and consequences of collective stupidity, a new factor emerged. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Collective stupidity: influences decision-making knowledge-based companies.

Research has shown that a major predictor of the effectiveness of diversity policy and interventions is the diversity perspective of employees, i.e. which outcomes they associate with cultural diversity in their work environment. Design/methodology/approach: The present study compares public servants' diversity perspectives in two similar independent samples, from 2008 (n = 1,617) and 2018 (n = 2,024), using the Benefits and Threats of Diversity Scale (BTDS; Hofhuis et al., 2015). Findings: Results show that in 2018, employees of the Netherlands' national government perceived more benefits of diversity for gaining insight about and access to different groups within society.

Purpose: The Netherlands' national government (Rijksoverheid) is an example of a large public organization that strives to recruit and retain employees from different cultural groups, and aims to reap the benefits of workplace diversity. Research has shown that a major predictor of the effectiveness of diversity policy and interventions is the diversity perspective of employees, i.e. which outcomes they associate with cultural diversity in their work environment. Design/methodology/approach: The present study compares public servants' diversity perspectives in two similar independent samples, from 2008 (n = 1,617) and 2018 (n = 2,024), using the Benefits and Threats of Diversity Scale (BTDS; Hofhuis et al., 2015). Findings: Results show that in 2018, employees of the Netherlands' national government perceived more benefits of diversity for gaining insight about and access to different groups within society. Additionally, contributions of cultural diversity to creativity and innovation within teams are reported significantly more often in 2018 than in 2008.

This study draws upon knowledge-based theory and an international perspective on entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial ecosystems to examine how collaboration between actors within an international entrepreneurial ecosystem (IEE) stimulates knowledge exploitation and, consequently, the success of international SME innovation and commercialization. To this end, we examined an international pharma-biotech SME and collected primary data from in-depth interviews with its top management team and triangulated the interview data with secondary data. The study was initiated before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued 11 months after. Our research findings contribute to the theory that the diversity of an IEE’s actors and the intensity of collaboration between them are fundamental to the dynamics of scientific, technological, market, and institutional knowledge exploitation and to international innovation success.

It aims to analyze the nature of the following correlations (a) the impact of workforce diversity on entrepreneurial innovation, (b) the impact of workforce diversity on performance, and (c) the impact of entrepreneurial innovation on performance. Using a cross-sectional survey design, we collected the primary data from heterogeneous respondents including 870 patients and 261 executives leading 87 major private hospitals and other medical centers in Lebanon. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is employed to predict multivariate causal relationships between latent constructs and measured variables. The results of the SEM model reveal that gender diversity (GD) is a key success factor of workforce performance in the Lebanese healthcare sector since it can increase both process innovation (PI) and organizational innovation (OI) and also enhance organizational performance (OP) and patient satisfaction (PS). The results indicate that age diversity (AD) especially the presence of youth in medical centers has a positive and significant impact on organizational performance and patient satisfaction. Finally, the results of this study show that the presence of women and youth in the Lebanese healthcare sector improves entrepreneurial innovation and thus, leads to enhance the performance level and the quality of healthcare outcomes. This research provides original information that supports executive managers in the healthcare sector during crisis periods.

This research explores the correlation between diversity, entrepreneurial innovation, and performance of the Lebanese healthcare sector during the COVID-19 pandemic period. It aims to analyze the nature of the following correlations (a) the impact of workforce diversity on entrepreneurial innovation, (b) the impact of workforce diversity on performance, and (c) the impact of entrepreneurial innovation on performance. Using a cross-sectional survey design, we collected the primary data from heterogeneous respondents including 870 patients and 261 executives leading 87 major private hospitals and other medical centers in Lebanon. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is employed to predict multivariate causal relationships between latent constructs and measured variables. The results of the SEM model reveal that gender diversity (GD) is a key success factor of workforce performance in the Lebanese healthcare sector since it can increase both process innovation (PI) and organizational innovation (OI) and also enhance organizational performance (OP) and patient satisfaction (PS). The results indicate that age diversity (AD) especially the presence of youth in medical centers has a positive and significant impact on organizational performance and patient satisfaction. Finally, the results of this study show that the presence of women and youth in the Lebanese healthcare sector improves entrepreneurial innovation and thus, leads to enhance the performance level and the quality of healthcare outcomes. This research provides original information that supports executive managers in the healthcare sector during crisis periods.

In addition to their traditional technical basis, advisors are now expected to organise multi-actor processes, facilitate learning, mediate conflict, etc. Innovation support services are inherently diverse. To date, no precise list of competencies required by agricultural advisors to support Interactive Innovation has been defined. To form the basis for a competency profile, we examine the competencies currently being expected from an agricultural advisor. This suggested profile, developed in the context of the H2020 i2connect project, is based on a literature review, semi-structured interviews with co-creation experts, and an online validation workshop. We explore five themes: (a) basic disposition and attitude, (b) content competence, (c) methodological competence, (d) organisational competence, and (e) reflection, learning, and personal development. In practice, the profile can be used as either a tool for setting up co-creation processes or as the foundation for the development of new training materials. We conclude with a recommendation to create teams of advisors rather than relying on individuals, as a team is more likely to comprise the diversity of required competencies. © 2021 by the authors.

The expectation that agricultural advisors will facilitate Interactive Innovation is accompa-nied by novel expectations for their competency profile. In addition to their traditional technical basis, advisors are now expected to organise multi-actor processes, facilitate learning, mediate conflict, etc. Innovation support services are inherently diverse. To date, no precise list of competencies required by agricultural advisors to support Interactive Innovation has been defined. To form the basis for a competency profile, we examine the competencies currently being expected from an agricultural advisor. This suggested profile, developed in the context of the H2020 i2connect project, is based on a literature review, semi-structured interviews with co-creation experts, and an online validation workshop. We explore five themes: (a) basic disposition and attitude, (b) content competence, (c) methodological competence, (d) organisational competence, and (e) reflection, learning, and personal development. In practice, the profile can be used as either a tool for setting up co-creation processes or as the foundation for the development of new training materials. We conclude with a recommendation to create teams of advisors rather than relying on individuals, as a team is more likely to comprise the diversity of required competencies. © 2021 by the authors.

The present study utilised a quantitative-methods approach to investigate factors affecting retailers' adoption of BDA across three countries. A survey questionnaire was used to collect data from managers and decision-makers in the retail industry. Data of 2278 respondents were analysed through structural equation modelling. The findings revealed that security concerns, external support, top management support, and rational decision making culture have a greater effect on BDA adoption in developed countries UK than in UAE and Egypt. However, competition intensity and firm size have a greater effect on BDA adoption in UAE and Egypt than in UK. Finally, human variables (competence of information system's staff and staff's information system knowledge) have a greater effect on BDA adoption in Egypt than UK and UAE. The findings indicate that a “one-size-fits-all” approach is insufficient in capturing the heterogeneity of managers across countries.

Big data analytics (BDA) has emerged as a significant area of research for both researchers and practitioners in the retail industry, indicating the importance and influence of solving data-related problems in contemporary business organization. The present study utilised a quantitative-methods approach to investigate factors affecting retailers' adoption of BDA across three countries. A survey questionnaire was used to collect data from managers and decision-makers in the retail industry. Data of 2278 respondents were analysed through structural equation modelling. The findings revealed that security concerns, external support, top management support, and rational decision making culture have a greater effect on BDA adoption in developed countries UK than in UAE and Egypt. However, competition intensity and firm size have a greater effect on BDA adoption in UAE and Egypt than in UK. Finally, human variables (competence of information system's staff and staff's information system knowledge) have a greater effect on BDA adoption in Egypt than UK and UAE. The findings indicate that a “one-size-fits-all” approach is insufficient in capturing the heterogeneity of managers across countries.

We consider financial, knowledge, cooperation, regulatory and demand-related obstacles, which we separate into two categories: market structure and lack or uncertainty about demand. Using a pooled sample of four Chilean innovation surveys and an instrumental variables approach novel to this literature to address endogeneity, we find that only demand and financial barriers seem to have a negative effect on the probability of generating innovations. When financial or demand barriers are present, they seem to be binding and take prevalence over all other obstacles, and when they are absent, other barriers become significant. We provide evidence of heterogeneous effects on different sectors, considering not only manufacturing and services but also primaries, a comparison that has not been previously conducted and holds relevance for developing economies. We show that knowledge obstacles are relevant to manufacturing and market structure and regulatory obstacles are relevant in the services sector, while demand and financial obstacles appear to matter across the board. The pervasiveness of financial and demand obstacles, their relationship with the remaining barriers, and the observed sectoral differences have important policy implications. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",demand for innovation; financial and demand barriers to innovation; innovation obstacles; instrumental variables; sectoral heterogeneity,Commerce; Manufacture; Public policy; Barriers to innovations; Demand for innovation; Endogeneity; Financial and demand barrier to innovation; Innovation obstacle; Instrumental variables; Knowledge cooperation; Market structures; Sectoral heterogeneity; Uncertainty; Finance; developing world; innovation; manufacturing; market system; service sector; Chile,"Álvarez, R., Crespi, G.A., Heterogeneous effects of financial constraints on innovation: evidence from chile (2015) Sci.

We study the effects of different types of obstacles to innovation on the probability of obtaining different firm-level innovation outcomes. We consider financial, knowledge, cooperation, regulatory and demand-related obstacles, which we separate into two categories: market structure and lack or uncertainty about demand. Using a pooled sample of four Chilean innovation surveys and an instrumental variables approach novel to this literature to address endogeneity, we find that only demand and financial barriers seem to have a negative effect on the probability of generating innovations. When financial or demand barriers are present, they seem to be binding and take prevalence over all other obstacles, and when they are absent, other barriers become significant. We provide evidence of heterogeneous effects on different sectors, considering not only manufacturing and services but also primaries, a comparison that has not been previously conducted and holds relevance for developing economies. We show that knowledge obstacles are relevant to manufacturing and market structure and regulatory obstacles are relevant in the services sector, while demand and financial obstacles appear to matter across the board. The pervasiveness of financial and demand obstacles, their relationship with the remaining barriers, and the observed sectoral differences have important policy implications. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","primacy demand financial obstacles hindering innovation. study effects different types obstacles innovation probability obtaining different firm-level innovation outcomes. consider financial, knowledge, cooperation, regulatory demand-related obstacles, separate categories: market structure lack uncertainty demand. pooled sample Chilean innovation surveys instrumental variables approach novel address endogeneity, demand financial barriers negative effect probability generating innovations. financial demand barriers present, binding prevalence obstacles, absent, barriers significant. provide evidence heterogeneous effects different sectors, considering manufacturing services primaries, comparison previously conducted holds relevance developing economies. knowledge obstacles relevant manufacturing market structure regulatory obstacles relevant services sector, demand financial obstacles appear matter board. pervasiveness financial demand obstacles, relationship remaining barriers, observed sectoral differences important policy implications. © 2021 Inc.","[[""primacy"", ""demand"", ""financial"", ""obstacles"", ""hindering"", ""innovation""], [""study"", ""effects"", ""different"", ""types"", ""obstacles"", ""innovation"", ""probability"", ""obtaining"", ""different"", ""firm"", ""level"", ""innovation"", ""outcomes""], [""consider"", ""financial"", ""knowledge"", ""cooperation"", ""regulatory"", ""demand"", ""related"", ""obstacles"", ""separate"", ""categories"", ""market"", ""structure"", ""lack"", ""uncertainty"", ""demand""], [""pooled"", ""sample"", ""chilean"", ""innovation"", ""surveys"", ""instrumental"", ""variables"", ""approach"", ""novel"", ""address"", ""endogeneity"", ""demand"", ""financial"", ""barriers"", ""negative"", ""effect"", ""probability"", ""generating"", ""innovations""], [""financial"", ""demand"", ""barriers"", ""present"", ""binding"", ""prevalence"", ""obstacles"", ""absent"", ""barriers"", ""significant""], [""provide"", ""evidence"", ""heterogeneous"", ""effects"", ""different"", ""sectors"", ""considering"", ""manufacturing"", ""services"", ""primaries"", ""comparison"", ""previously"", ""conducted"", ""holds"", ""relevance"", ""developing"", ""economies""], [""knowledge"", ""obstacles"", ""relevant"", ""manufacturing"", ""market"", ""structure"", ""regulatory"", ""obstacles"", ""relevant"", ""services"", ""sector"", ""demand"", ""financial"", ""obstacles"", ""appear"", ""matter"", ""board""], [""pervasiveness"", ""financial"", ""demand"", ""obstacles"", ""relationship"", ""remaining"", ""barriers"", ""observed"", ""sectoral"", ""differences"", ""important"", ""policy"", ""implications""], [""inc""]]"

In addition, the moderating effect of environmental innovation in carbon-intensive versus non-carbon-intensive industries is also examined. Using data of the companies listed on the Standards & Poor's 500 index from 2002 to 2018, the 2SLS regression results indicate a statistically significant negative relationship between board gender diversity and carbon emissions. Environmental innovation amplifies the extent of this relationship. We find evidence that the moderation effect of environmental innovation is more pronounced for carbon-intensive firms than non-carbon-intensive firms. Our findings reinforce various corporate governance initiatives and public policy being undertaken all over the globe to encourage more gender diversity in the board of directors, demonstrating that board diversity enhances better board effectiveness in satisfying the needs of broader groups of stakeholders’ interests. The findings could be beneficial for stakeholders and regulators concerned with improving corporate governance mechanisms as well as reducing the carbon footprint. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Board of directors; Carbon emissions; Carbon-intensive industries; Corporate governance; Environmental innovation; Gender diversity,Carbon footprint; Industrial management; Public policy; Boards of directors; Carbon emissions; Carbon emissions reductions; Carbon-intensive industry; Corporate governance; Corporates; Environmental innovations; Gender diversity; Moderating effect; Stakeholder interest; Emission control; administrative framework; carbon emission; carbon footprint; corporate strategy; environmental technology; gender role; governance approach; innovation; organizational framework; stakeholder; standard (reference),"Adams, R.B., Women on boards: the superheroes of tomorrow?

This article investigates how the board diversity affects firms’ carbon emissions reduction and whether environmental innovation moderates this relationship. In addition, the moderating effect of environmental innovation in carbon-intensive versus non-carbon-intensive industries is also examined. Using data of the companies listed on the Standards & Poor's 500 index from 2002 to 2018, the 2SLS regression results indicate a statistically significant negative relationship between board gender diversity and carbon emissions. Environmental innovation amplifies the extent of this relationship. We find evidence that the moderation effect of environmental innovation is more pronounced for carbon-intensive firms than non-carbon-intensive firms. Our findings reinforce various corporate governance initiatives and public policy being undertaken all over the globe to encourage more gender diversity in the board of directors, demonstrating that board diversity enhances better board effectiveness in satisfying the needs of broader groups of stakeholders’ interests. The findings could be beneficial for stakeholders and regulators concerned with improving corporate governance mechanisms as well as reducing the carbon footprint. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Board gender diversity, environmental innovation corporate carbon emissions. article investigates board diversity affects firms’ carbon emissions reduction environmental innovation moderates relationship. addition, moderating effect environmental innovation carbon-intensive versus non-carbon-intensive industries examined. data companies listed Standards & Poor's 500 index 2002 2018, 2SLS regression results indicate statistically significant negative relationship board gender diversity carbon emissions.

Innovators source ideas while interacting with peers at different levels and intensities. With a dataset of disambiguated inventors from 1980 to 2010 in European metropolitan areas, we assess the influence of their interactions with co-workers, organizations’ colleagues, and geographically co-located peers on their productivity. By adding many fixed effects to control for unobserved heterogeneity, we uncover the importance of metropolitan areas knowledge for inventors’ productivity, with firms and co-workers’ network knowledge being less relevant.

It explores the effect of innovation on non-financial performance (learning and growth; internal processes) of Malaysian manufacturing companies. Three hundred eighty-eight questionnaires were collected from middle and top engineers, managers, and technicians and were used to conduct the analyses. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is used for testing the developed hypotheses. The result of analyses confirmed the impact of determinants (absorptive capacity, functional diversity, and knowledge network) on knowledge quality. This study also confirmed that knowledge quality has a significant impact on innovation, while innovation has a significant effect on non-financial performance. This paper also revealed that knowledge quality determinants have a significant influence on the non-financial performance of manufacturing firms in Malaysia. The present study examined the relationship between these factors (related to internal and external knowledge), knowledge quality, innovation, and non-financial performance (internal process and learning and growth) in the manufacturing companies of Malaysia. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,"The efficiency of the innovation factors on competitive advantage (2018) Journal of Management and Science, 8 (1), pp. 20-25; Structural Equation Modeling in Practice: A Review and Recommended Two-Step Approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103, pp. 411-423; Development of a new approach to guided self-help via the Internet.

This paper proposes a framework that investigates the impact of knowledge quality on innovation in Malaysian manufacturing firms. It explores the effect of innovation on non-financial performance (learning and growth; internal processes) of Malaysian manufacturing companies. Three hundred eighty-eight questionnaires were collected from middle and top engineers, managers, and technicians and were used to conduct the analyses. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is used for testing the developed hypotheses. The result of analyses confirmed the impact of determinants (absorptive capacity, functional diversity, and knowledge network) on knowledge quality. This study also confirmed that knowledge quality has a significant impact on innovation, while innovation has a significant effect on non-financial performance. This paper also revealed that knowledge quality determinants have a significant influence on the non-financial performance of manufacturing firms in Malaysia. The present study examined the relationship between these factors (related to internal and external knowledge), knowledge quality, innovation, and non-financial performance (internal process and learning and growth) in the manufacturing companies of Malaysia. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Knowledge quality non-financial performance—A Malaysian experience. paper proposes framework investigates impact knowledge quality innovation Malaysian manufacturing firms. explores effect innovation non-financial performance (learning growth; internal processes) Malaysian manufacturing companies. eighty-eight questionnaires collected middle engineers, managers, technicians conduct analyses.

Specifically, we theorize that the congruency between idea framing and audiences' mental construals depends on audiences' level of expertise in evaluating novel ideas. In four experiments, we found that innovators benefit from deploying framing strategies congruent with audiences' mental construals: novices (e.g., lay people, crowdfunders) appreciate more novel ideas framed in abstract why terms, while experts (e.g., professional investors, innovation managers) novel ideas framed in concrete how terms. Integrating the strategic framing of novel ideas with construal level theory and audience heterogeneity contributes to research on entrepreneurship, innovation, and impression management. Managerial Summary: One of the critical challenges that innovators (e.g., entrepreneurs) face is to persuade relevant audiences (e.g., users, crowdfunders, professional investors, and innovation managers) to support their novel ideas. This article integrates various literatures concerned with the evaluation of novelty to examine the impact of different framing strategies on the reception of novel ideas by different audiences. By demonstrating that the framing of a novel business idea affects audience members' evaluation, and that the effectiveness of different frames (why vs. how) varies with the target audiences (novices vs. experts), we offer actionable insights into how innovators can strategically use linguistic framing to increase the likelihood of eliciting favorable evaluations and resource commitment for their ideas. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",audiences; framing; narratives/storytelling; novel idea; novices/experts,Linguistics; Construal levels; Critical challenges; Framing strategies; Impression management; Innovation manager; Professional investors; Resource commitment; Social psychology; Managers,"Aadland, E., Cattani, G., Falchetti, D., Ferriani, S., Reflecting glory or deflecting stigma?

Research Summary: Building on social psychology research and entrepreneurship work on linguistic framing, we argue that the appreciation of novel ideas varies with the mental construal that members of different audiences use to evaluate them. Specifically, we theorize that the congruency between idea framing and audiences' mental construals depends on audiences' level of expertise in evaluating novel ideas. In four experiments, we found that innovators benefit from deploying framing strategies congruent with audiences' mental construals: novices (e.g., lay people, crowdfunders) appreciate more novel ideas framed in abstract why terms, while experts (e.g., professional investors, innovation managers) novel ideas framed in concrete how terms. Integrating the strategic framing of novel ideas with construal level theory and audience heterogeneity contributes to research on entrepreneurship, innovation, and impression management. Managerial Summary: One of the critical challenges that innovators (e.g., entrepreneurs) face is to persuade relevant audiences (e.g., users, crowdfunders, professional investors, and innovation managers) to support their novel ideas. This article integrates various literatures concerned with the evaluation of novelty to examine the impact of different framing strategies on the reception of novel ideas by different audiences. By demonstrating that the framing of a novel business idea affects audience members' evaluation, and that the effectiveness of different frames (why vs. how) varies with the target audiences (novices vs. experts), we offer actionable insights into how innovators can strategically use linguistic framing to increase the likelihood of eliciting favorable evaluations and resource commitment for their ideas. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Start “Why,” to: strategic framing novel ideas different audiences.

Hence, understanding which factors help them perform successfully is crucial, especially regarding their peculiarities in a scientific environment. This study focuses on essential factors such as team composition and diversity in USOs in the biotech sector in 64 founding teams in Switzerland and Germany. By identifying the team composition, and going beyond the usual team characteristics, along with checking in parallel for network and financing effects, the paper adds empirical evidence to the ongoing debate if and how team diversity in USOs affects the performance of this special group of newly founded firms. We test our hypotheses with the partial least squares method (PLS). Our results from the mediation model show how the diversity of teams is related to networks and financial resources and affects the performance. In addition, our study reveals the direct and indirect effects of team diversity on success in USOs. This way we contribute to the ongoing discussion on performance investigating the sources of team effects more in detail. © 2020, The Author(s).",Entrepreneurship; Financing; Networks; Performance; Team composition;

University spin-offs (USOs) are an important driver for innovation, along with economic and social development. Hence, understanding which factors help them perform successfully is crucial, especially regarding their peculiarities in a scientific environment. This study focuses on essential factors such as team composition and diversity in USOs in the biotech sector in 64 founding teams in Switzerland and Germany. By identifying the team composition, and going beyond the usual team characteristics, along with checking in parallel for network and financing effects, the paper adds empirical evidence to the ongoing debate if and how team diversity in USOs affects the performance of this special group of newly founded firms. We test our hypotheses with the partial least squares method (PLS). Our results from the mediation model show how the diversity of teams is related to networks and financial resources and affects the performance. In addition, our study reveals the direct and indirect effects of team diversity on success in USOs.

Although researchers have documented the effectiveness of BWCs, little research has been done to examine why police departments decide to use them in the first place. Based on an innovation framework, the current study aims to explain what factors determine police departments’ decisions to implement BWCs. By examining 139 U.S. police departments using event history analyses, I find that the police departments with a higher severity of police-involved deaths of minority residents and a higher strength of social movements protesting police brutality are more likely to implement BWCs. In addition, some organizational and environmental factors, including the availability of federal grants and the council-manager form of government, have significant associations with BWC implementation. Findings also suggest that different patterns of BWC implementation are demonstrated according to environmental context. © The Author(s) 2020.",body-worn cameras; event history analysis; local policy adoption; police use of force; protest event,accountability; governance approach; innovation; law enforcement; local government; minority group; police force; policy approach; policy implementation; racial disparity; social movement; technology adoption; United States,"(2014) War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing, , New York, ACLU Foundation; Ariel, B., Sutherland, A., Henstock, D., Young, J., Drover, P., Sykes, J., Megicks, S., Report: Increases in Police use of Force in the Presence of Body-worn Cameras are Driven by Officer Discretion: A Protocol-based Subgroup Analysis of Ten Randomized Experiments (2016) Journal of Experimental Criminology, 12 (3), p. 453. , (,):, –63; Ariel, B., Sutherland, A., Henstock, D., Young, J., Drover, P., Sykes, J., Megicks, S., Contagious Accountability: A Global Multisite Randomized Controlled Trial on the Effect of Police Body-worn Cameras on Citizens’ Complaints Against the Police (2017) Criminal Justice and Behavior, 44 (2), pp. 293-316; Ariel, B., Farrar, W.A., Sutherland, A., The Effect of Police Body-worn Cameras on Use of Force and Citizens’ Complaints Against the Police: A Randomized Controlled Trial (2015) Journal of Experimental Criminology, 31 (3), p. 509. , (,):, –35; Bass, S., Policing Space, Policing Race: Social Control Imperatives and Police Discretionary Decisions (2001) Social Justice, 28 (1), p. 156. , (,):, –76; Beattie, C., Weitzer, R., Race, Democracy, and Law: Civilian Review of Police in Washington, DC (2010) Civilian Oversight of Policing: Governance, Democracy and Human Rights, , Goldsmith A., Lewis C., (eds), Portland, Hart Publishing,,. edited by, Chapter 2, 41–62; Berry, F.S., Berry, W.D., State Lottery Adoptions as Policy Innovations: An Event History Analysis (1990) The American Political Science Review, 84 (2), pp. 395-415; Braga, A., Coldren, J.R., Jr., Sousa, W., Rodriguez, D., Alper, O., (2017) The benefits of body-worn cameras: new findings from a randomized controlled trial at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, , https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/251416.pdf, Final report to the National Institute of Justice, Accessed April 20, 2019; Braga, A., Brunson, R.K., Drakulich, K.M., Race, Place, and Effective Policing (2019) Annual Review of Sociology, 45, p. 535. , –55; Celona, L., NYPD in a ‘Snap’ Judgment: PBA and Brass Resist Order to Carry Cameras (2013) New York Post, , http://nypost.com/2013/08/14/nypd-in-a-snap-judgment-pba-and-brass-resist-orderto-carry-cameras, August, 14, Accessed June 16, 2019; Cooper, H.L.F., War on Drugs Policing and Police Brutality (2015) Substance Use & Misuse, 50 (8-9), p. 1188. , (,):, –94; Crank, J.P., The Influence of Environmental and Organizational Factors on Police Style in Urban and Rural Environments (1990) Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, 27 (2), p. 166. , (,):, –89; Crank, J.P., Wells, L.E., The Effects of Size and Urbanism on Structure Among Illinois Police Departments (1991) Justice Quarterly, 8 (2), p. 169. , (,):, –85; Crow, M.S., Snyder, J.A., Crichlow, V.J., Smykla, J.O., Community Perceptions of Police Body-worn Cameras: The Impact of Views on Fairness, Fear, Performance, and Privacy (2017) Criminal Justice and Behavior, 44 (4), pp. 589-610; Daley, D.M., Garand, J.C., Horizontal Diffusion, Vertical Diffusion, and Internal Pressure in State Environmental Policy Making, 1989-1998 (2005) American Politics Research, 33 (5), p. 615. , (,):, –44; (2015) Coalition Presents State-by-state Police Body Cam Research, , http://www.dcogc.org/printpdf/content/coalition-presents-state-state-police-body-cam-research-0, June, 12, Accessed March 6, 2018; (2015) Justice Department Awards over $23 million in Funding for Body Worn Camera Pilot Program to Support Law Enforcement Agencies in 32 States, , https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-awards-over-23-million-funding-body-worn-camera-pilot-program-support-law, Accessed March 20, 2018; (2016) Advancing Diversity in Law Enforcement, , https://www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/file/900761/download, Accessed June 20, 2019; (2017) The Civil Rights Division’s Pattern and Practice Police Reform Work: 1994-present, , https://www.justice.gov/crt/file/922421/download, Accessed October 10, 2018; Dolan, B., To knock or not to knock?

As the issue continues to batter the world, the call for mitigation initiatives is becoming louder. In responding to this call we take a multidisciplinary approach to examining board diversity as an innovative solution in tackling climate change. Utilizing data from 69 fossil fuel organizations, our findings suggest that increasing female representation and foreign culture representation on the board can effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the main contributor to climate change. In part, this is achieved through responsible leadership and innovation. Our contributions reach beyond traditional board diversity literature, where the benefits of diversity are confined primarily to a discussion of corporate social responsibilities.

The goal of this research was to describe the diversity of management practices in owner-managed SMEs. Understanding this diversity will raise awareness of the challenges SMEs are facing and suggest possible solutions that will help improve their management and sustainability. In this study, 205 owner-managed SMEs with more than nine people employed were analyzed using a company self-assessment based on a tailor-made governance model. Data were analyzed using statistical analysis software in combination with a visual analysis. To group similar companies, the cluster analysis technique was used. The results showed a high diversity in how companies were managed and their performances. This research indicated that statistical analysis itself is not sufficient for exploring this diversity, and other approaches, such as visual analysis, must be used as well. © 2021 by the authors.

A large proportion of small and medium-sized enterprises are managed by their owners and founders. The goal of this research was to describe the diversity of management practices in owner-managed SMEs. Understanding this diversity will raise awareness of the challenges SMEs are facing and suggest possible solutions that will help improve their management and sustainability. In this study, 205 owner-managed SMEs with more than nine people employed were analyzed using a company self-assessment based on a tailor-made governance model. Data were analyzed using statistical analysis software in combination with a visual analysis. To group similar companies, the cluster analysis technique was used. The results showed a high diversity in how companies were managed and their performances. This research indicated that statistical analysis itself is not sufficient for exploring this diversity, and other approaches, such as visual analysis, must be used as well. © 2021 by the authors.

This descriptive and quantitative study discusses the results obtained after implementing an open innovation program to promote access to internships for university students with disabilities, in which three multi-national companies have participated. We used the Job Typicalness, Quality of Work Life and Employment Maturity Interview Questionnaires to collect information. The results show that the jobs performed by disabled participants are similar to those of other workers. This job typicality positively influences their perception of quality of life and job satisfaction. The open innovation process has focused on collaboration to provide accessibility and equity to the procedures of human resources departments for access to employment, that is, external collaboration has been used to offer an equal-opportunity hiring process. The information obtained allows us to conclude that companies need to increase their training and/or knowledge in the fields of diversity and inclusion to eliminate the barriers of access to employment found in hiring processes. This study reveals the importance of this type of open innovation among companies and organizations, not only for establishing diversity-sensitive human resources policies, but also for promoting the talent attraction with equal opportunities and an inclusive labour market. © 2021 by the authors.

These are types of projects with the greatest uncertainty in all aspects, and the application of antifragile philosophy can result in streamlining their management and development. In this article, the Q methodology is used to investigate whether organizations in R&D environments have antifragile characteristics. To this end, 15 innovation experts from research institutes located in Northern Spain were interviewed about their position regarding project management behaviors that are related to antifragile philosophy. As a result, it was verified that the characteristics of an ideal system of a research institute with antifragile philosophy are multidisciplinary and autonomous teams with a capacity for rapid response and adaptation to the environment. © 2021 by the authors.

First, a two-way fixed effects regression model is proposed. Then, this study finds that the examined Chinese family firms’ risk-taking, which is measured by their Z-scores and innovation intensity, is lower than that of the nonfamily firms. This result confirms the prediction of social-emotional wealth theory. Second, a diversity index is formulated to summarize the above three dimensions of board diversity. By regressing risk-taking measures on these board diversity features, this study finds that firms with less-diverse boards take more risks. Finally, the effects of the interaction between family ownership and board diversity are explored. The results reveal that the examined dimensions of board diversity have significant influences on risk-taking: family firms with lower levels of board diversity generally take more risks than those with higher levels of board diversity. Our study contributes to the literature on risk-taking of family business and has important practical implications for motivating family business innovation in China. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Board diversity; Chinese family firms; Risk-taking; Socioemotional wealth,,"Adams, R.B., Ferreira, D., Women in the boardroom and their impact on governance and performance (2009) Journal of Financial Economics, 94 (2), pp. 291-309; Adams, R.B., Hermalin, B.E., Weisbach, M.S., The role of boards of directors in corporate governance: A conceptual framework and survey (2010) Journal of Economic Literature, 48 (1), pp. 58-107; Adams, R.B., Mehran, H., Bank board structure and performance: Evidence for large bank holding companies (2012) Journal of Financial Intermediation, 21 (2), pp. 243-267; Alessandri, T.M., Mammen, J., Eddleston, K., Managerial incentives, myopic loss aversion, and firm risk: A comparison of family and non-family firms (2018) Journal of Business Research, 91, pp. 19-27; Anderson, R.C., Reeb, D.M., Founding-family ownership and firm performance: Evidence from the S&P 500 (2003) The Journal of Finance, 58 (3), pp. 1301-1328; Arellano, M., (2003) Panel data econometrics, , Oxford University Press; Arnaboldi, F., Casu, B., Kalotychou, E., Sarkisyan, A., The performance effects of board heterogeneity: What works for EU banks?

Using a sample of more than 1,500 Chinese listed firms over four years of observation (2015–2018), this study examines the effects of family ownership and certain features of board diversity (gender diversity, age diversity, and education diversity) on the risk-taking of Chinese listed firms. First, a two-way fixed effects regression model is proposed. Then, this study finds that the examined Chinese family firms’ risk-taking, which is measured by their Z-scores and innovation intensity, is lower than that of the nonfamily firms. This result confirms the prediction of social-emotional wealth theory. Second, a diversity index is formulated to summarize the above three dimensions of board diversity. By regressing risk-taking measures on these board diversity features, this study finds that firms with less-diverse boards take more risks. Finally, the effects of the interaction between family ownership and board diversity are explored. The results reveal that the examined dimensions of board diversity have significant influences on risk-taking: family firms with lower levels of board diversity generally take more risks than those with higher levels of board diversity. Our study contributes to the literature on risk-taking of family business and has important practical implications for motivating family business innovation in China. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Board diversity risk-taking family firms: Evidence China. sample 1,500 Chinese listed firms years observation (2015–2018), study examines effects family ownership certain features board diversity (gender diversity, age diversity, education diversity) risk-taking Chinese listed firms.

Drawing from the faultline and cross-categorization literature, we suggest that organizational demographic faultlines (based on age and gender) have the potential to either reduce or enhance employees’ collective organizational identification and, thereby, indirectly influence firm performance and innovation. Whether organizational demographic faultlines have detrimental or beneficial effects depends on the functional heterogeneity within faultline-based demographic subgroups, where heterogeneity is defined as the extent to which subgroup members belong to different functional departments. We theorize that this functional heterogeneity alters the degree of social integration between demographic subgroups. Results from a multisource field study of demographic faultlines among 5,495 employees in 82 small and medium-sized firms (<250 employees) support our model. We demonstrate that organizational demographic faultlines have important consequences, and we show that functional heterogeneity changes whether these consequences are negative or positive. © 2021 The Authors.

Stud.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114027238,"Organizational Demographic Faultlines: Their Impact on Collective Organizational Identification, Firm Performance, and Firm Innovation. In this study, we seek to understand the consequences of demographic faultlines at the organizational level. Drawing from the faultline and cross-categorization literature, we suggest that organizational demographic faultlines (based on age and gender) have the potential to either reduce or enhance employees’ collective organizational identification and, thereby, indirectly influence firm performance and innovation. Whether organizational demographic faultlines have detrimental or beneficial effects depends on the functional heterogeneity within faultline-based demographic subgroups, where heterogeneity is defined as the extent to which subgroup members belong to different functional departments. We theorize that this functional heterogeneity alters the degree of social integration between demographic subgroups. Results from a multisource field study of demographic faultlines among 5,495 employees in 82 small and medium-sized firms (<250 employees) support our model. We demonstrate that organizational demographic faultlines have important consequences, and we show that functional heterogeneity changes whether these consequences are negative or positive. © 2021 The Authors.

The study is based on a sample of 3023 firm-year observations from European companies operating in 22 countries between 2009 and 2016. Data on the resources, emissions, and innovation dimensions of environmental performance and board governance data were collected from the Refinitiv database, whereas financial data were extracted from the Worldscope database. The study employs a multilevel modeling analysis and the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation technique to analyze the data. The findings suggest that board gender diversity and the presence of a corporate social responsibility and sustainability committee have a positive impact on environmental performance. The results also show that country governance quality is positively related to environmental performance. The findings have important implications for practitioners, regulators, and policymakers with respect to the effectiveness of corporate governance mechanisms and country governance systems in determining corporate environmental practices. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",board characteristics; corporate governance; country governance quality; environmental performance; sustainable development,database; environmental planning; sustainability; sustainable development; Europe,"Amran, A., Lee, S.P., Devi, S.S., The influence of governance structure and strategic corporate social responsibility toward sustainability reporting quality (2014) Business Strategy and the Environment, 23 (4), pp. 217-235. , https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.1767; Anderson, A., Gupta, P.P., A cross-country comparison of corporate governance and firm performance: Do financial structure and the legal system matter?

Strategy Environ.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105723773,"Toward sustainable development: Board characteristics, country governance quality, and environmental performance. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of board characteristics and country governance quality on both individual aspects and the overall level of environmental performance through the lens of agency, resource dependency, and institutional theories. The study is based on a sample of 3023 firm-year observations from European companies operating in 22 countries between 2009 and 2016. Data on the resources, emissions, and innovation dimensions of environmental performance and board governance data were collected from the Refinitiv database, whereas financial data were extracted from the Worldscope database. The study employs a multilevel modeling analysis and the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation technique to analyze the data. The findings suggest that board gender diversity and the presence of a corporate social responsibility and sustainability committee have a positive impact on environmental performance. The results also show that country governance quality is positively related to environmental performance. The findings have important implications for practitioners, regulators, and policymakers with respect to the effectiveness of corporate governance mechanisms and country governance systems in determining corporate environmental practices. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","sustainable development: Board characteristics, country governance quality, environmental performance. objective study examine effects board characteristics country governance quality individual aspects overall level environmental performance lens agency, resource dependency, institutional theories. study sample 3023 firm-year observations European companies operating 22 countries 2009 2016.

Specifically, we differentiate between the effects of Family Management (family CEO, family managerial involvement, and next-generation involvement in the business) and Family Guardianship (trustees and family council) and study their effects on explorative and exploitative modes of innovation strategy. Our analysis of unique survey data from 328 UK private family firms shows that specific dimensions of Family Management (next-generation involvement) and Family Guardianship (the existence of a family council) are significantly positively associated with exploration. Exploitation, however, is positively associated with next-generation involvement only.

Drawing on agency and stewardship theories, we examine how two dimensions of family governance influence family firm innovation strategy. Specifically, we differentiate between the effects of Family Management (family CEO, family managerial involvement, and next-generation involvement in the business) and Family Guardianship (trustees and family council) and study their effects on explorative and exploitative modes of innovation strategy. Our analysis of unique survey data from 328 UK private family firms shows that specific dimensions of Family Management (next-generation involvement) and Family Guardianship (the existence of a family council) are significantly positively associated with exploration. Exploitation, however, is positively associated with next-generation involvement only. These findings answer calls to theorize and empirically examine the heterogeneity of family firms’ innovation modes.

Herein, we describe a new model for STEM higher education transformation, the Sustainable, Transformative Engagement across a Multi-Institution/Multidisciplinary STEM, (STEM)2, “STEM-squared”, Network. The Network embraces a pathways model, as opposed to a pipeline model, to STEM career entry. It is founded upon three strong theoretical frameworks: Communities of Transformation, systems design for organizational change, and emergent outcomes for the diffusion of innovations in STEM education. Currently composed of five institutions—three private 4-year universities and two public community colleges—the Network capitalizes on the close geographic proximity and shared student demographics to effect change across the classroom, disciplinary, institutional, and inter-institutional levels. Results: The (STEM)2 Network has increased the extent to which participants feel empowered to be change agents for STEM higher education reform and has increased collaboration across disciplines and institutions. Participants were motivated to join the Network to improve STEM education, to improve the transfer student experience, to collaborate with colleagues across disciplines and institutions, and because they respected the leadership team. Participants continue to engage in the Network because of the collaborations created, opportunities for professional growth, opportunities to improve STEM education, and a sense that the Network is functioning as intended. Conclusion: The goal to increase the number and diversity of people entering STEM careers is predicated on transforming the STEM higher education system to embrace a pathways model to a STEM career. The (STEM)2 Network is achieving this by empowering faculty to transform the system from the inside. While the systemic transformation of STEM higher education is challenging, the (STEM)2 Network directly addresses those challenges by bridging disciplinary and institutional silos and leveraging the reward structure of the current system to support faculty as they work to transform this very system. © 2021, The Author(s).",Collaborations; Inter-institutional; Interdisciplinary; Network; STEM education transformation; Transfer students,,"Vision and change in undergraduate biology education: A call to action (2011) American Association for the Advancement of Science, , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11528-013-0690-9; Anderson, W.A., Banerjee, U., Drennan, C.L., Elgin, S.C.R., Epstein, I.R., Handelsman, J., Hatfull, G.F., Olivera, B.M., Changing the culture of science education at research universities (2011) Educate, 10, p. 12; Asai, D.J., Bauerle, C., From HHMI: doubling down on diversity (2016) CBE—Life Sciences Education, 15 (3), p. fe6; (2009) Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians, , Washington, DC, Association of American Medical Colleges - Howard Hughes Medical Institute; Bell, S., Morse, S., How people use rich pictures to help them think and act (2013) Systemic Practice and Action Research, 26 (4), pp. 331-348; (2015) Scholarship Reconsidered: Priorities of the Professoriate, , New York, NY, Wiley; Brinton, P.H.M.P., A plea for rationally co-ordinated courses in analytical chemistry (1924) Journal of Chemical Education, 1 (12), p. 226; Brownell, S.E., Freeman, S., Wenderoth, M.P., Crowe, A.J., BioCore guide: a tool for interpreting the core concepts of vision and change for biology majors (2014) CBE—Life Sciences Education, 13 (2), pp. 200-211; (2012) Occupational outlook handbook, 2012-2013, , http://www.bls.gov/ooh; Cannady, M.A., Greenwald, E., Harris, K.N., Problematizing the STEM pipeline metaphor: is the STEM pipeline metaphor serving our students and the STEM workforce?

To examine this, we draw on the upper-echelons literature and on research on business models as activity systems to theorize that cognitive and ideological diversity in TMTs will affect teams’ attention to business model innovation (BMI) and companies’ BMI intensity. Analysis of longitudinal data from firms in the US printing and publishing industry provides support for the theory that, over time, TMT cognitive and ideological diversity have a positive influence on BMI. Whereas cognitive diversity expands TMT’s BMI attention-scope, both cognitive and ideological diversity increase BMI intensity. However, too much ideological diversity has a negative effect. We furthermore find that TMT longevity moderates the effects of TMT diversity positively, suggesting that the benefit of diversity grows as team members work together longer as a team. We discuss the study’s contributions to the literature on diversity, BMI, and the upper echelons. © 2020 Society for the Advancement of Management Studies and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",business models; cognition; conservatism-liberalism; executive leaders; team longevity; values,,"Abramowitz, A.I., Saunders, K.L., Is polarization a myth?

As top management teams (TMTs) become progressively more diverse, an important question arises: how does greater TMT diversity affect a company’s ability to innovate its business model? To examine this, we draw on the upper-echelons literature and on research on business models as activity systems to theorize that cognitive and ideological diversity in TMTs will affect teams’ attention to business model innovation (BMI) and companies’ BMI intensity. Analysis of longitudinal data from firms in the US printing and publishing industry provides support for the theory that, over time, TMT cognitive and ideological diversity have a positive influence on BMI. Whereas cognitive diversity expands TMT’s BMI attention-scope, both cognitive and ideological diversity increase BMI intensity. However, too much ideological diversity has a negative effect. We furthermore find that TMT longevity moderates the effects of TMT diversity positively, suggesting that the benefit of diversity grows as team members work together longer as a team. We discuss the study’s contributions to the literature on diversity, BMI, and the upper echelons. © 2020 Society for the Advancement of Management Studies and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Attention Action: Influence Cognitive Ideological Diversity Management Teams Business Model Innovation. management teams (TMTs) progressively diverse, important question arises: greater TMT diversity affect company’s ability innovate business model? examine this, draw upper-echelons research business models activity systems theorize cognitive ideological diversity TMTs affect teams’ attention business model innovation (BMI) companies’ BMI intensity.

It proposes a new approach to reconnect the contingency factors to the optimization of productivity. This helps us to identify the changing characteristics that influence the determinants of decisions, actions and management of the technological projects of the mainly innovative enterprises. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses techniques that effectively solve unobserved endogeneity and heterogeneity problems in enterprises: an empirical–structural design. With this method, this study enables rich empirical conceptualization and helps with extending theory. However, there is a need to further the research by taking into account the system analysis and the complexity of the research object: one of the options might be to explore a possible follow-up of the research through drawing on ethnostatistics and qualimetrics. Findings: The analysis reveals that the phenomenon of technological project productivity in operational governance context is thus manifested by the coexistence of the applied governance configuration variables, the contingency factors operationalization, the optimizing productivity mechanisms and this with the secular innovation and stagnation and stagnation. Ceteris paribus, the governance operationalizations have an important role in the productivity of technological projects of the innovative enterprises. Originality/value: This research is the first to mobilize as major determinants of the operationalization of governance, the oversight of the capital, the dividend strategy and the system control, the managerial follow-up, the detection of opportunistic behaviours and the application of governing incentives (among others) as governance configuration variables in order to highlight their interactions with productivity in the innovative firm technological projects. For this reason alone, the paper will be referenced by other authors in the future. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Enterprise administration; Enterprise development; Enterprise information; Governance operationalizations; Technological project performance,,"Acs, Z.J., Lafuente, E., Sanders, M., Szerb, L., (2017) Productivity and growth: the relevance of the national system of entrepreneurship, , Working paper WP17-03, Financial and Institutional Reforms to build an Entrepreneurial Society (FIRES) Project; Aerts, W., Cheng, P., Tarca, A., Management's earnings justification and performances management under different regimes (2013) An International Review, 21 (1), pp. 93-115; Alon, T., Berger, D., Dent, R., Pugsley, B., Older and slower: the startup deficit's lasting effects on aggregate productivity growth (2018) Journal of Monetary Economics, 93, pp. 68-85; Altman, E., Brady, B., Resti, A., Sironi, A., The link between default and recovery rates: theory, empirical evidence and implications (2005) Journal of Business, (November), pp. 2203-2227; Amedzro St-Hilaire, W., The strategic configurations as a contingency factor in the success of operational risk measures (2018) Strategic Change: Briefings in Entrepreneurial Finance, 27 (5), pp. 495-503; Amedzro St-Hilaire, W., De La Robertie, C., The influence of IT innovation mechanisms on healthcare project management strategies (2017) Journal of Economics and Business, 31 (1), pp. 94-103; Amedzro St-Hilaire, W., De La Robertie, C., The empirical impacts of risk-management on the enhancement of control mechanisms in organizational studies (2017) Recherches en Sciences de Gestion - Management Sciences - Ciencias de Gestión, (123), pp. 23-46; Andrews, D., Criscuolo, C., Gal, P., (2015) Frontier firms, technology diffusion and public policy: micro evidence from OECD, , Working Paper No 2, OECD Productivity; Anglin, P., Edelstein, R., Gao, Y., Tsang, D., What is the relationship between REIT governance and performances management?

Enterp. Inf. Manage.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092278184,"Reconnecting governance configuration variables to enterprises contingency factors for optimizing productivity at the start-up level. Purpose: The article broaches the important topic of the relationships between governance operationalizations and productivity at the start-up level. It proposes a new approach to reconnect the contingency factors to the optimization of productivity. This helps us to identify the changing characteristics that influence the determinants of decisions, actions and management of the technological projects of the mainly innovative enterprises. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses techniques that effectively solve unobserved endogeneity and heterogeneity problems in enterprises: an empirical–structural design. With this method, this study enables rich empirical conceptualization and helps with extending theory. However, there is a need to further the research by taking into account the system analysis and the complexity of the research object: one of the options might be to explore a possible follow-up of the research through drawing on ethnostatistics and qualimetrics. Findings: The analysis reveals that the phenomenon of technological project productivity in operational governance context is thus manifested by the coexistence of the applied governance configuration variables, the contingency factors operationalization, the optimizing productivity mechanisms and this with the secular innovation and stagnation and stagnation. Ceteris paribus, the governance operationalizations have an important role in the productivity of technological projects of the innovative enterprises. Originality/value: This research is the first to mobilize as major determinants of the operationalization of governance, the oversight of the capital, the dividend strategy and the system control, the managerial follow-up, the detection of opportunistic behaviours and the application of governing incentives (among others) as governance configuration variables in order to highlight their interactions with productivity in the innovative firm technological projects.

This paper aims to analyze whether the service companies’ intensity of openness and innovation efforts are related to their innovative and financial performances. Open innovation assumes that organizations should use external and internal resources as they develop new technologies. Design/methodology/approach: The study used data from the survey of technological innovation (Pintec). As regards innovations, it was considered the commercial and operational innovation performances and the innovative novelty performance. As regards financial performance, it was considered the overall net sales per employee. The intensity of open innovation was measured by the combination of breadth and depth (diversity and importance of the interfaces). The innovative effort was measured by spending on innovation activities. Regressions were applied to evaluate a set of hypotheses. Findings: The results indicate that companies with a greater orientation toward open innovation presented better scores. The results also lead to the conclusion that foreign firm ownership structure and being part of a corporate group were the factors that caused the greatest impact on financial performance in the service sector.

This condition occurs because embeddedness in global network structures may improve firm innovation and performance. In addition, the improvement of firm innovativeness and performance seems higher when globally networked firms both compete and cooperate between and among them. In this paper, we categorize the simultaneous interplay of cooperation and competition in the global arena as global network coopetition (GNC). Under GNC, multinational enterprises act jointly with their global partners-rivals to improve performance, at the same time by sharing complementary resources (cooperation side) and by undertaking independent actions to enhance their own performance (competition side). This paper aims to expand existing research on network and global coopetition by shedding light on the effects of coopetition between and among firms belonging to global network structures on value capture and innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 100 firms belonging to 14 industries organized in 47 global networks of different sizes, the authors conducted a longitudinal empirical study over the period 2000-2014 covering 1,098 observations, 1,717 interfirm relationships and 78 inter-networks linkages. A multiple regression model on panel data with random effects was conducted on the sample of 1,098 observations related to the global automotive industry to test the research hypotheses. Findings: Findings show that GNC enhances firm performance and innovation outcomes. In addition to GNC, structural characteristics such as network size, network position and network diversity have significant positive or negative effects on innovation and performance outcomes of firms belonging to these global network structures. Research limitations/implications: Our research offers a contribution to the literature dealing with global networked structures’ effects on firm innovation performance. In fact, it effectively complements prior work on outcomes of coopetition between firms embedded in complex network structures. It also advances research in the area by introducing the notion of GNC as a network by which firms can enhance their innovation performance and, therefore, their global innovation performance. This study has some limitations. First, we acknowledge that it is focused only on 14 global coopetitive networks. It could be promising to extend the scope to integrate other networks. Second, our measures of firm actions as based on a content analysis of news reports related to firms. It would be important to complement this data collection by conducting a qualitative analysis (interviews). Atlast, it could be promising to include the study of customer needs in the new product development process. Practical implications: Our study also offers some insights into the management of coopetition. In fact, by taking into account the existence of a context in which global coopetition networks play a role, managers may be better positioned to effectively deal with the paradox of being a partner of their direct rivals to improve their firms’ innovativeness and, consequently, achieve good performance, on the one hand, and to maintain relationships within several networks by taking into account their structural properties such as centrality and diversity, on the other hand. Originality/value: We contribute to extant network coopetition literature in two ways. First, we introduce the notion of GNC to detect coopetition occurrence in global network structures. GNC refers to a context where actors in various networks belonging to different industries and geographies cooperate in a one (or more) innovative project/s, while simultaneously keeping on competing within and between their networks. Second, we contribute to network coopetition by analyzing specific GNC effects on firm innovation performance. In so doing, we can provide a deeper analytical understanding of GNC performance effects on firms operating in global network contexts. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Automotive industry; Global network coopetition; Globalization; Innovation performance; Networks; Value creation,,"Afuah, A., Are network effects really all about size?

Bus. Ind. Mark.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082811544,"Global network coopetition, firm innovation and value creation. Purpose: Studies on inter-firm relationships have recently shifted their attention from dyadic networks to more globally driven network structures. This condition occurs because embeddedness in global network structures may improve firm innovation and performance. In addition, the improvement of firm innovativeness and performance seems higher when globally networked firms both compete and cooperate between and among them. In this paper, we categorize the simultaneous interplay of cooperation and competition in the global arena as global network coopetition (GNC). Under GNC, multinational enterprises act jointly with their global partners-rivals to improve performance, at the same time by sharing complementary resources (cooperation side) and by undertaking independent actions to enhance their own performance (competition side). This paper aims to expand existing research on network and global coopetition by shedding light on the effects of coopetition between and among firms belonging to global network structures on value capture and innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 100 firms belonging to 14 industries organized in 47 global networks of different sizes, the authors conducted a longitudinal empirical study over the period 2000-2014 covering 1,098 observations, 1,717 interfirm relationships and 78 inter-networks linkages. A multiple regression model on panel data with random effects was conducted on the sample of 1,098 observations related to the global automotive industry to test the research hypotheses. Findings: Findings show that GNC enhances firm performance and innovation outcomes. In addition to GNC, structural characteristics such as network size, network position and network diversity have significant positive or negative effects on innovation and performance outcomes of firms belonging to these global network structures. Research limitations/implications: Our research offers a contribution to the literature dealing with global networked structures’ effects on firm innovation performance. In fact, it effectively complements prior work on outcomes of coopetition between firms embedded in complex network structures. It also advances research in the area by introducing the notion of GNC as a network by which firms can enhance their innovation performance and, therefore, their global innovation performance. This study has some limitations. First, we acknowledge that it is focused only on 14 global coopetitive networks. It could be promising to extend the scope to integrate other networks. Second, our measures of firm actions as based on a content analysis of news reports related to firms. It would be important to complement this data collection by conducting a qualitative analysis (interviews). Atlast, it could be promising to include the study of customer needs in the new product development process. Practical implications: Our study also offers some insights into the management of coopetition. In fact, by taking into account the existence of a context in which global coopetition networks play a role, managers may be better positioned to effectively deal with the paradox of being a partner of their direct rivals to improve their firms’ innovativeness and, consequently, achieve good performance, on the one hand, and to maintain relationships within several networks by taking into account their structural properties such as centrality and diversity, on the other hand. Originality/value: We contribute to extant network coopetition literature in two ways. First, we introduce the notion of GNC to detect coopetition occurrence in global network structures. GNC refers to a context where actors in various networks belonging to different industries and geographies cooperate in a one (or more) innovative project/s, while simultaneously keeping on competing within and between their networks. Second, we contribute to network coopetition by analyzing specific GNC effects on firm innovation performance. In so doing, we can provide a deeper analytical understanding of GNC performance effects on firms operating in global network contexts. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Global network coopetition, firm innovation value creation.

Successful TT depends on effective communication between academic and external partners. This is best facilitated by an academic intermediary who can provide meaningful interactions. An academic intermediary can ensure expertise and knowledge are communicated using a common language and that goals and expectations are clear between partners. In the field of remote sensing where complex technologies, datasets and analyses are required to develop user friendly products, intermediaries play a particularly essential role. The rapid expansion of the remote sensing sector over the last decade, including sensor technologies and the volume of freely available data, has created a bottleneck between available data and technology and ready to use products. In an effort to address this bottleneck and establish a long-term innovation platform and thematic TT infrastructure, FERN.Lab, Remote Sensing for Sustainable Use of Resources Helmholtz Innovation Lab was founded at the Geodesy Department of the German Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) in January 2020. FERN.Lab is funded by the Helmholtz Association, the largest scientific organization in Germany. The goal of FERN.Lab is to facilitate TT and deliver remote sensing products to commercial and non-commercial partners by acting as an expert intermediary platform. FERN.Lab will improve the TT activities of GFZ from two distinct approaches. The first is a “pull” approach where tailor-made technologies are developed for and funded by external third parties. The second is a “push” approach where existing departmental technologies with high market potential are promoted. The pull and push of technologies to external partners is accomplished by a set of competencies and services delivered by the core FERN.Lab team. Competencies include business development, scientific development, software development, and public relations which directly address institutional, financial and skills gap that can cause the TT process to fail. By implementing a robust TT framework for remote sensing products, the impact of research has the potential to be much broader and farther reaching. Additionally, these efforts can improve the acceptance of remote sensing outside of academia improving and modernizing methods used in diverse sectors which in turn can benefit not only individual partners but also politics, society, and the environment.

Although the advantages of teams for innovating are virtually undisputed, we have only a very rudimentary understanding of their success drivers. To shed more light on innovation teams, we conceptualize multiplicity in expertise as nonredundant expertise and distinguish it from factors that facilitate or hinder the integration of this expertise. These factors are overlap in expertise, disparity in team members’ status, and whether or not teams use automation technology. We use the empirical context of molecular biology, especially the part of this field in which teams produce and exchange genetic material in the form of so-called plasmids. Combining data about plasmids from a central plasmid repository (AddGene) with bibliometric data endows us with a rich dataset capturing information about team diversity in addition to two innovation performance measures (the number of plasmid orders and the number of citations attracted by publications). Our analysis shows that multiplicity in expertise increases innovation performance; this relationship is strengthened by the overlap in expertise and weakened by disparity in status and the use of the automation technology. Our paper provides a more detailed theory of expertise diversity and contributes to the diversity literature. Our findings also lead to implications for practitioners. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",AddGene; Automation; Disparity; Diversity; Expertise; Gender; Innovation teams; Molecular biology; Science of team science; Status,Molecular biology; Automation technology; Bibliometric; Genetic materials; Innovation performance; Non-redundant; Team diversity; Team members; DNA,"Adams, J.D., Black, G.C., Clemmons, J.R., Stephan, P.E., Scientific teams and institutional collaborations: evidence from U.S. universities, 1981-1999 (2005) Res.

Innovation increasingly relies on collaboration in teams instead of individual efforts. Although the advantages of teams for innovating are virtually undisputed, we have only a very rudimentary understanding of their success drivers. To shed more light on innovation teams, we conceptualize multiplicity in expertise as nonredundant expertise and distinguish it from factors that facilitate or hinder the integration of this expertise. These factors are overlap in expertise, disparity in team members’ status, and whether or not teams use automation technology. We use the empirical context of molecular biology, especially the part of this field in which teams produce and exchange genetic material in the form of so-called plasmids. Combining data about plasmids from a central plasmid repository (AddGene) with bibliometric data endows us with a rich dataset capturing information about team diversity in addition to two innovation performance measures (the number of plasmid orders and the number of citations attracted by publications). Our analysis shows that multiplicity in expertise increases innovation performance; this relationship is strengthened by the overlap in expertise and weakened by disparity in status and the use of the automation technology. Our paper provides a more detailed theory of expertise diversity and contributes to the diversity literature.

While formal theoretical work has focused on value creation strategies, empirical evidence suggests that substantial performance differences also arise from heterogeneity in bargaining. We develop a model where rival firms choose value-based innovation strategies to enhance either value creation or bargaining capabilities. We show a tendency for homogeneous strategy choices, with coordination on bargaining promoting firm value capture at the expense of overall industry value creation. We identify conditions for strategic heterogeneity, wherein a firm that enhances its bargaining capability risks the sustainability of its competitive advantage. Our model incorporates a natural distinction between incremental and radical value-creating innovations, which influences the risk-return tradeoffs faced by firms in their strategies. Managerial Summary: A critical strategy choice for a firm's management is where to focus innovation efforts. Should it be on increasing the value the firm creates with other players, or on enhancing the firm's ability to bargain for a greater share of existing value creation? We develop a theory to inform such choices among rival firms. We show that there can be opportunities for rival firms to enhance their performance by coordinating innovation efforts on bargaining rather than on a race for value creation. However, the ability to coordinate on bargaining is undermined when value-creating innovations allow firms to disrupt extant market structures, in which case the pursuit of high-risk, high-return value-creating innovations may become attractive to individual firms even at the expense of overall industry profitability. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",bargaining capability; biform games; firm heterogeneity; sustainability of competitive advantage; value-based innovation strategies,Competition; Competitive advantage; Firm Performance; Industry profitability; Innovation strategy; Market structures; Strategy choices; Value creation; Value-based strategies; Commerce,"Adegbesan, J.A., Higgins, M.J., The intra-alliance division of value created through collaboration (2011) Strategic Management Journal, 32 (2), pp. 187-211; Adner, R., When are technologies disruptive?

Research Summary: The value-based perspective emphasizes the importance of both value creation and bargaining for firm performance. While formal theoretical work has focused on value creation strategies, empirical evidence suggests that substantial performance differences also arise from heterogeneity in bargaining. We develop a model where rival firms choose value-based innovation strategies to enhance either value creation or bargaining capabilities. We show a tendency for homogeneous strategy choices, with coordination on bargaining promoting firm value capture at the expense of overall industry value creation. We identify conditions for strategic heterogeneity, wherein a firm that enhances its bargaining capability risks the sustainability of its competitive advantage. Our model incorporates a natural distinction between incremental and radical value-creating innovations, which influences the risk-return tradeoffs faced by firms in their strategies. Managerial Summary: A critical strategy choice for a firm's management is where to focus innovation efforts. Should it be on increasing the value the firm creates with other players, or on enhancing the firm's ability to bargain for a greater share of existing value creation? We develop a theory to inform such choices among rival firms. We show that there can be opportunities for rival firms to enhance their performance by coordinating innovation efforts on bargaining rather than on a race for value creation. However, the ability to coordinate on bargaining is undermined when value-creating innovations allow firms to disrupt extant market structures, in which case the pursuit of high-risk, high-return value-creating innovations may become attractive to individual firms even at the expense of overall industry profitability. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","choice value-based strategies rivalry: enhance value creation bargaining capabilities.

Others have described how a nation is constructed and maintained through everyday ‘banal nationalism’. This article combines the two to observe how state-led and everyday nationalisms are combined into a national promotional food narrative in order to attract travellers and the economic benefits they bring. Through thematic content analysis of all the food-related texts on the Singapore Tourism Board’s website this article uncovers dominant ideologies shaping tourism strategies aimed at driving consumption. Contrasting themes of heritage and innovation, unity and diversity, and local and international in food culture are presented to visitors, at the same time as defining the local people as consumers to further stimulate consumption. These findings drive analysis of how consumption may be depicted in a way that amounts to state-sponsored ingestion of a country and its people. © The Author(s) 2019.",Culture; food; identity; nation branding; nation building; tourism,,"Anderson, B., (1983) Imagined Communities, , London, Verso; Anholt, S., Nation-brands of the twenty-first century (1998) Journal of Brand Management, 5 (6), pp. 395-406; Appadurai, A., How to make national cuisine: Cookbooks in contemporary India (1988) Comparative Studies in Society and History, 30 (1), pp. 3-24; Bell, D., Valentine, G., (1997) Consuming Geographies: We Are Where We Eat, , New York, Routledge; Billig, M., (1995) Banal Nationalism, , London, Sage; Bolin, G., Ståhlberg, P., Mediating the nation-state: Agency and the media in nation-branding campaigns (2014) International Journal of Communication, 9, pp. 3065-3083; Brookes, R., Newspapers and national identity: The BSE/CJD crisis and the British press (1999) Media, Culture and Society, 21, pp. 247-263; Brulotte, R.L., Giovine, M.A., (2014) Edible Identities: Food as Cultural Heritage, , Farnham, Ashgate; Castelló, E., Mihelj, S., Selling and consuming the nation: Understanding consumer nationalism (2018) Journal of Consumer Culture, 18 (4), pp. 558-576; Chua, B.H., Taking the street out of the street food (2016) Food, Foodways and Foodscapes: Culture, Community and Consumption in Post-Colonial Singapore, pp. 23-40. , Kong L., Sinha V., (eds), Hackensack, NJ, World Scientific, In:, (eds; Chua, B.H., Rajah, A., Hybridity, ethnicity and food in Singapore (1996) Changing Chinese Foodways in Asia, pp. 161-200. , Wu Y.H., Tan C.B., (eds), Hong Kong, Chinese University Press, In:, (eds; Chua, B.H., Rajah, A., Food, ethnicity and nation (2003) Life Is Not Complete Without Shopping: Consumption Culture in Singapore, pp. 96-120. , Chua B.H., (ed), Singapore, National University of Singapore Press, In:, (eds; Cook, I., Crang, P., The world on a plate: Culinary culture, displacement and geographical knowledge (1996) Journal of Material Culture, 1 (2), pp. 131-154; Corvo, P., (2015) Food Culture, Consumption and Society, , Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan; Cusack, I., African cuisines: Recipes for nation-building?

Scholars have noted the power of state-led discourse to create a national identity as an imagined community and have explicitly linked food to state-orchestrated narratives of nationhood. Others have described how a nation is constructed and maintained through everyday ‘banal nationalism’. This article combines the two to observe how state-led and everyday nationalisms are combined into a national promotional food narrative in order to attract travellers and the economic benefits they bring. Through thematic content analysis of all the food-related texts on the Singapore Tourism Board’s website this article uncovers dominant ideologies shaping tourism strategies aimed at driving consumption. Contrasting themes of heritage and innovation, unity and diversity, and local and international in food culture are presented to visitors, at the same time as defining the local people as consumers to further stimulate consumption.

It follows that the adoption of hybrid technology approaches, following universal design principles, can help to integrate access to education and sign language literacy. Design/methodology/approach: The working method used to carry out this work consists of a systematic review of the scientific literature. This is a research project based on the recapitulation of information about sign language in the international panorama and the improvements used for its instruction. For this purpose, the well-known PRISMA (Moher et al., 2009) is used to synthesize the search carried out. A systematic review of the articles published in scientific journals about pedagogy in the teaching of sign language in the international field and technological innovation for sign language teaching has been carried out, incorporating different approaches and personal assessments. The first phase of the method consists of identifying and analyzing the articles published in scientific journals on the teaching of sign language on the international scene and the importance of new educational models with the incorporation of various didactic adaptations, evaluating the selected articles over a period of time from 2009 to 2021. Six steps were used in the systematic review study (Figure 1). First, Steps 1–4 were conducted in 2020 and 2021 as part of a doctoral research. A schematic summary of Steps 1–4 is presented below, followed by Steps 5 and 6, added later to the study after completion of Step 4. In the case of the first four steps they were conducted by two researchers: the thesis tutor and the doctoral student, and Steps 5 and 6 were conducted by the Ph. Findings: To carry out the analysis of the results, the codification of the variables was carried out. The selected studies are characterized by their international context with a final selection of 39 studies have found several variables that affect the relationship between the teaching of sign language in the international arena and the use of technological innovations to adapt their teaching to students (Figure 4). In this section we present the technology grouped variables included in each factor and the possibilities of standardization and applicability of sign language teaching in the international panorama. Within these articles, the importance of defining training programs in sign language for teachers and the need to evaluate teaching programs is identified, with a focus on actions to improve school curricula to achieve linguistic standardization and inclusion in the academic environment, as well as their use at all levels of education. Therefore, professional practices and cooperation between institutions such as: associations of families of deaf students and educational institutions must be improved, making it possible to give a quality education. Within the exclusion criteria, the articles that do not use sign language teaching tools (n = 45) were subsequently discarded, followed by the articles that do not indicate any intervention in students with disabilities (n = 48), concluding with the articles that nonsign language disability education (n = 44). Subsequently, among those selected, the technology articles that do not speak about sign language were discarded (n = 32), as well as the studies that protect indigenous language but not sign language (n = 33) and, to conclude, the linguistic normalization articles but do not cite sign language (n = 37). Originality/value: Communication is the element by which the authors can understand each other with the rest of the people around us, in the diversity of language, within non-verbal language, the authors find sign language, the language of deaf and mute people, of families, as a professional employee and nowadays, learned by many non-deaf and mute people to achieve a more inclusive and integrated society with all people. Every country has the right to have its own sign language, especially one that claims its culture and customs, through non-verbal communication with which to express multiple meanings, emotions and intentions. It is essential to know and apply the technological advances that are being developed, promoting the right to autonomy and the defense of the indigenous language as a cultural element of the intangible heritage of each country. The use of technology allows the democratization of culture and access to information regardless of where one lives in the world, in an increasingly globalized society in which communication plays a fundamental role. In the case of the global pandemic, it has forced us to the advancement of home education and the use of efficient digital tools to achieve it such as videoconferencing, in the field of disability there are still many limitations on this use by the various companies that develop them. Within the inclusive educational research the authors must emphasize the need for equality of tools and content for all types of students, especially in sign language. Large digital gaps have been generated in families with and without resources at international level, which also have a member with a disability, this is pointed out in the research mentioning the current situation of the American continent, as well as the search for improvement of the tools and platforms in which they are developed. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Deaf; Disability; Education; Sign,,"Abuzinadah, N.E., (2020) An Avatar-Based System for Arabic Sign Language to Enhance Hard-of-Hearing and Deaf Students' Performance in a Fundamentals of Computer Programming Course, , http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/858041/, Doctoral dissertation, University of Surrey; Aditama, P.W., Putra, P.S.U., Yusa, I.M.M., Putra, I.N.T.A., Designing augmented reality sibi sign language as a learning media (2021) Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1810 (1). , p., IOP Publishing; Alvarez, T., Álvarez, F., Carreño, M., Proposal for an interactive software system design for learning Mexican sign language with leap motion (2020) HCI International 2020 – Late Breaking Papers: Universal Access and Inclusive Design.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a questionnaire survey to collect data and test the hypotheses developed in this study. The authors sent the questionnaires to the accounting and finance managers of the manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The authors received 259 responses from a total of 579 questionnaires sent or a 44.73% response rate. This study excludes 36 responses for further analyzes due to incomplete responses (five responses) and responses from lower-level employees (31 responses). The remaining 223 responses are used for statistical analyzes. Findings: This study hypothesizes and finds that misalignments among business strategy, leadership style, organizational culture and MAS are negatively associated with both financial and non-financial performance. Research limitations/implications: The study has three limitations. First, the authors intentionally collect data from the manufacturing industry to minimize the effect of data heterogeneity. To improve the generalizability of the study, future research might consider using data from other industries. Second, the study measures business strategy based on respondents’ perception of their companies’ strategy using indicators representing either product differentiation or cost leadership strategy. Future studies might use different ways of measuring business strategy using more objective empirical proxies such as research and development expenditures or premium price capability. Finally, this study conducts a survey and measures all the variables in a single period. Future studies might use a longitudinal approach to investigate the evolution of companies’ strategies and their impact on leadership styles, organizational commitment and MAS. Practical implications: The results of the study will help companies in their search for senior executives, in building their organizational culture and in implementing their MAS. The study suggests that product differentiation companies should search for transformational leaders that empower their subordinates to take initiative and encourage innovative ideas in performing their tasks. In regard to MAS, the results suggest that product differentiation companies should implement broad focus MAS that emphasize the balance between financial and non-financial factors. By contrast, cost leadership companies should search for transactional leaders who emphasize on completing tasks on hand effectively and efficiently. In regard to MAS, the findings suggest that cost leadership companies will benefit more from using narrow focus MAS such as formal planning and budgeting, variance analyzes and cost-volume-profit analyzes. Social implications: The findings of the study suggest that product differentiation companies should build a flexible culture that encourages subordinates to take the risk and effectively manage opportunities and challenges through changes and innovation. Furthermore, cost leadership companies should build a controlled culture that promotes adherence to policies and procedures to minimize costs and increase efficiency. Originality/value: This paper introduces to the management and accounting literature the concept of fit among competitive strategy, leadership style, organizational culture and MAS and uses the two-stage method proposed by Ittner and Larcker (2001) to measure the degree of misalignment among business strategy and its contextual variables and, in turn, examines the impacts of the misalignment on financial and non-financial performance. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Business strategy;

Little is known about the collaborative process underlying this development. The objective of the paper is to explore the collaborative mechanisms and dynamics that influence the process and characteristics of sustainable innovations. The translation approach of the actor–network theory is applied to shed light on the collaborative process of two cases of sustainable innovations within small-and medium-sized enterprises. The sociotechnical graph method is used as a methodology to track the mechanisms and compare the dynamics of their processes. The results reveal that the governance characteristic of sustainable innovations and the moment of mobilization are essential aspects of the collaborative processes. They show that, depending on the intensity and systemic impacts of SI, attraction and retention are important mechanisms in the construction of the governance characteristics of SI. A manager who uses these mechanisms during the mobilization of actors, having resources related to the governance characteristics, succeeds in sustainable innovation development. The paper contributes to the literature on sustainability management by linking the ‘becoming’ of sustainable innovations to their collaborative processes. It also informs managers on how to manage the collaborative process of sustainable innovations by relying on a translation approach. © 2021 by the authors.

The development of sustainable innovation (SI) is complex and risky due to the characteristics and diversity of actors involved in its process. Little is known about the collaborative process underlying this development. The objective of the paper is to explore the collaborative mechanisms and dynamics that influence the process and characteristics of sustainable innovations. The translation approach of the actor–network theory is applied to shed light on the collaborative process of two cases of sustainable innovations within small-and medium-sized enterprises. The sociotechnical graph method is used as a methodology to track the mechanisms and compare the dynamics of their processes. The results reveal that the governance characteristic of sustainable innovations and the moment of mobilization are essential aspects of the collaborative processes. They show that, depending on the intensity and systemic impacts of SI, attraction and retention are important mechanisms in the construction of the governance characteristics of SI. A manager who uses these mechanisms during the mobilization of actors, having resources related to the governance characteristics, succeeds in sustainable innovation development. The paper contributes to the literature on sustainability management by linking the ‘becoming’ of sustainable innovations to their collaborative processes. It also informs managers on how to manage the collaborative process of sustainable innovations by relying on a translation approach. © 2021 by the authors.

We also find that this positive association is stronger in countries with weak stakeholder orientation, countries with weak legal environments, and countries without mandatory CSR reporting requirements. These findings suggest that CSR contracting can compensate for institutional voids and high stakeholder demand for CSR, and thereby foster firm innovation. The results of the channel analyses suggest that a greater level of employee innovation productivity, enhanced managerial risk-taking, and greater responsiveness of firms' R&D investment to their investment opportunities play a significant role in the association between CSR contracting and innovation. Overall, our study demonstrates in a global context the importance of linking executive compensation to nonfinancial criteria in addition to financial criteria, and it documents the heterogeneity in the effect of CSR contracting on firm innovation in different countries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",CSR contracting; Executive compensation; Innovation; International; Patent; Sustainability,,"Acharya, V.V., Subramanian, K.V., Bankruptcy codes and innovation (2009) Rev.

Financ.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113302760,"Integrating corporate social responsibility criteria into executive compensation and firm innovation: International evidence. Using a large sample of firms from 30 countries, we find that the integration of corporate social responsibility (CSR) criteria into executive compensation is associated with greater innovation output in countries around the world. We also find that this positive association is stronger in countries with weak stakeholder orientation, countries with weak legal environments, and countries without mandatory CSR reporting requirements. These findings suggest that CSR contracting can compensate for institutional voids and high stakeholder demand for CSR, and thereby foster firm innovation. The results of the channel analyses suggest that a greater level of employee innovation productivity, enhanced managerial risk-taking, and greater responsiveness of firms' R&D investment to their investment opportunities play a significant role in the association between CSR contracting and innovation. Overall, our study demonstrates in a global context the importance of linking executive compensation to nonfinancial criteria in addition to financial criteria, and it documents the heterogeneity in the effect of CSR contracting on firm innovation in different countries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Integrating corporate social responsibility criteria executive compensation firm innovation: International evidence. sample firms 30 countries, integration corporate social responsibility (CSR) criteria executive compensation associated greater innovation output countries world. positive association stronger countries weak stakeholder orientation, countries weak legal environments, countries mandatory CSR reporting requirements. findings suggest CSR contracting compensate institutional voids high stakeholder demand CSR, foster firm innovation. results channel analyses suggest greater level employee innovation productivity, enhanced managerial risk-taking, greater responsiveness firms' R&D investment investment opportunities play significant role association CSR contracting innovation.

We test our hypotheses on a unique data set of more than 5,000 board game design projects conducted by either teams of professional game designers or by hobbyist (user) designers. Our study lends support for the notion that knowledge diversity is a double-edged sword that has opposing effects on the two dimensions of team creativity, novelty and usefulness. We argue and find that teams composed of self-rewarded users in the household sector are better able than teams of professionals to translate the informational benefits of knowledge diversity into novel concepts and game designs. Finally, we find that user teams are in general more likely to create truly creative (i.e. novel and useful) game designs. This particular result emphasizes the relevance of research on HHS innovation and shows that user designers from the HHS are able to conduct collective development work more effectively than teams of professional designers. © 2020","Free innovation; Household sector; Information processing; Knowledge diversity; Shared mental models JEL: L20, L67, O30, O31; Team creativity; User innovation",Statistical tests; Game designers; Household sectors; Knowledge diversity; Novel concept; Professional designers; Team creativity; Two-dimension; User designers; Professional aspects,"Aggarwal, I., Woolley, A.W., Team creativity, cognition, and cognitive style diversity (2019) Management Science, 65 (4), pp. 1586-1599; Agresti, A., Agresti, B.F., Statistical analysis of qualitative variation (1978) Sociological Methodology, 9, pp. 204-237; Ahuja, G., The duality of collaboration: Inducements and opportunities in the formation of interfirm linkages (2000) Strategic Management Journal, 21 (3), pp. 317-343; Ahuja, G., Lampert, C.M., Tandon, V., (2008) 1 moving beyond Schumpeter: management research on the determinants of technological innovation, 2, pp. 1-98. , Academy of Management Annals; Alexy, O., Leitner, M., A fistful of dollars: Are financial rewards a suitable management practice for distributed models of innovation?

This study adds to the literature on household sector (HHS) innovation by investigating how user and professional designer teams differ in their ability to translate knowledge diversity into collective creative output. We test our hypotheses on a unique data set of more than 5,000 board game design projects conducted by either teams of professional game designers or by hobbyist (user) designers. Our study lends support for the notion that knowledge diversity is a double-edged sword that has opposing effects on the two dimensions of team creativity, novelty and usefulness. We argue and find that teams composed of self-rewarded users in the household sector are better able than teams of professionals to translate the informational benefits of knowledge diversity into novel concepts and game designs. Finally, we find that user teams are in general more likely to create truly creative (i.e. novel and useful) game designs. This particular result emphasizes the relevance of research on HHS innovation and shows that user designers from the HHS are able to conduct collective development work more effectively than teams of professional designers. © 2020","Knowledge diversity team creativity: hobbyists beat professional designers creating novel board games. study adds household sector (HHS) innovation investigating user professional designer teams differ ability translate knowledge diversity collective creative output. test hypotheses unique data set 5,000 board game design projects conducted teams professional game designers hobbyist (user) designers. study lends support notion knowledge diversity double-edged sword opposing effects dimensions team creativity, novelty usefulness. argue teams composed self-rewarded users household sector better able teams professionals translate informational benefits knowledge diversity novel concepts game designs.

To explore the heterogeneous framing processes involved within a firm, we conducted an in-depth case study of the response of a multinational insurance group to a digitally-led disruptive innovation: the rise of internet-based general insurance aggregator platforms between 2002 and 2007. We map different response frames across three separate framing dimensions: the Challenge Type, Response Urgency and Firm Heritage, and explore their interplay in shaping responses to disruption. We introduce the idea of multiplexed framing – comprised of multiple, non-binary frames – and propose that these are holographically distributed – such that conflicting frames can be held by members of the same organizational department or group. This allows managers to leverage the ambiguity generated by multiplexed frames to select the same response strategies for different reasons leading to an equifinal resolution of conflict. We show how such framing enables the organization to trial and adaptively iterate between different strategic responses to disruptive innovation, particularly amid high uncertainty and ambiguity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Ambiguity; Digital disruption; Disruptive innovation; Framing,Finance; Digital innovations; Disruptive innovations; Firm heterogeneity; Incumbent response; Internet based; Response strategies; Socio-cognitive; Strategic response; Enterprise resource planning; cognition; innovation; insurance system; organization; political ideology; uncertainty analysis,"Accenture, The Evolution of Aggregators: Impacts and Future Challenges for Insurers (2010), http://www.accenture.com/microsites/insights/Documents/pdfs/RoleOfAggregators_09_10.pdf, [online] London.

Research applying a socio-cognitive lens to disruptive digital innovation often fails to account for intra-firm heterogeneity in how an established incumbent frames and responds to disruptive innovation. To explore the heterogeneous framing processes involved within a firm, we conducted an in-depth case study of the response of a multinational insurance group to a digitally-led disruptive innovation: the rise of internet-based general insurance aggregator platforms between 2002 and 2007. We map different response frames across three separate framing dimensions: the Challenge Type, Response Urgency and Firm Heritage, and explore their interplay in shaping responses to disruption. We introduce the idea of multiplexed framing – comprised of multiple, non-binary frames – and propose that these are holographically distributed – such that conflicting frames can be held by members of the same organizational department or group. This allows managers to leverage the ambiguity generated by multiplexed frames to select the same response strategies for different reasons leading to an equifinal resolution of conflict. We show how such framing enables the organization to trial and adaptively iterate between different strategic responses to disruptive innovation, particularly amid high uncertainty and ambiguity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Pluralist perspectives diverse responses: Exploring multiplexed framing incumbent responses digital disruption.

From a business perspective, virtual as opposed to physical mobility of staff may increase efficiency by cutting costs and saving time. Furthermore, cultural diversity in international teams may enhance productivity because multiple perspectives have the potential to engender creative thinking processes and innovation. However, there is a body of literature that reports on the difficulties experienced in cross-cultural online collaboration, and the need for training that addresses the specific challenges of this work context. The GVTs Project, an inter-university inter-disciplinary cooperation that is run across business schools in different countries by language and business teachers, was set up to provide students with pre-workplace experience of such work scenarios. The aim of this chapter is to show how the multi-layered nature of culture in GVTs that is reported in the literature has been built into the pedagogical design of the GVTs Project. Participant reports and the results of a survey administered during the project suggest that the project design fosters a differentiated understanding of the impact of culture and communication on virtual teamwork. © P.I.E.

From a business perspective, virtual as opposed to physical mobility of staff may increase efficiency by cutting costs and saving time. Furthermore, cultural diversity in international teams may enhance productivity because multiple perspectives have the potential to engender creative thinking processes and innovation. However, there is a body of literature that reports on the difficulties experienced in cross-cultural online collaboration, and the need for training that addresses the specific challenges of this work context. The GVTs Project, an inter-university inter-disciplinary cooperation that is run across business schools in different countries by language and business teachers, was set up to provide students with pre-workplace experience of such work scenarios. The aim of this chapter is to show how the multi-layered nature of culture in GVTs that is reported in the literature has been built into the pedagogical design of the GVTs Project.

Drawing upon social exchange theory and social cognitive theory, we developed a multilevel model of the relationships between dual-focused transformational leadership (TFL) and service innovation at the team and individual levels, as well as mediating and moderating mechanisms behind the relationships. Data were collected from team leaders and their employees from hospitality organisations in Henan Province, China. Multilevel structural equation modelling (MSEM) was employed to validate the model. The results showed that team-focused TFL promoted team service innovation via developmental culture while individual-focused TFL promoted employee service innovative behaviour via creative self-efficacy. Group openness diversity concurrently moderated the relationship between developmental culture and team service innovation, and the relationship between individual-focused TFL and creative self-efficacy.

Service innovation from hospitality employees can contribute to improving service quality and further facilitating hospitality organisations to gain competitive advantage and maintain prosperity. Drawing upon social exchange theory and social cognitive theory, we developed a multilevel model of the relationships between dual-focused transformational leadership (TFL) and service innovation at the team and individual levels, as well as mediating and moderating mechanisms behind the relationships. Data were collected from team leaders and their employees from hospitality organisations in Henan Province, China. Multilevel structural equation modelling (MSEM) was employed to validate the model. The results showed that team-focused TFL promoted team service innovation via developmental culture while individual-focused TFL promoted employee service innovative behaviour via creative self-efficacy. Group openness diversity concurrently moderated the relationship between developmental culture and team service innovation, and the relationship between individual-focused TFL and creative self-efficacy.

During the process of industrial transformation and development, technical progress is the key driving force, and for China, technical changes in the industrial sector began during the 12th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2011–2015). Thus, this paper improves the decomposition of the traditional Malmquist DEA index to distinguish and quantify the effects of independent innovation and learning by doing and analyzes the impact of R&D and learning by doing on regional industrial development during the 12th FYP. Findings reveal consistency between the effect of “learning by doing” and “independent innovation” in technical progress during the 12th FYP, and the overall trend shows a V-shaped decline first and then later an increase. The heterogeneity of industrial structure in domestic regional economies present differences in independent innovation and learning by doing, among which the northeast region is highly sensitive to the effect of learning by doing. Therefore, strengthening the training of production departments and improving employee productivity are two key tasks in the northeast region. © 2021",Industrial restructuring; Learning-by-doing effect; Malmquist index; Regional industry; Technical progress,Economic and social effects; Industrial economics; Industrial research; Five-year plans; Independent innovation; Industrial restructuring; Industrial structures; Industrial transformations; Learning-by-doing; Learning-by-doing effect; Malmquist indices; Regional industry; Technical progress; Personnel training; economic development; economic growth; industrial structure; regional economy; research and development,"Afsharian, M., Ahn, H., The overall malmquist index: a new approach for measuring productivity changes over time (2015) Ann.

In the new normal economy and under supply-side structural reform progress, industry has become the pillar of economic development, thus making it urgent to adjust and upgrade a country's industrial structure both scientifically and effectively. During the process of industrial transformation and development, technical progress is the key driving force, and for China, technical changes in the industrial sector began during the 12th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2011–2015). Thus, this paper improves the decomposition of the traditional Malmquist DEA index to distinguish and quantify the effects of independent innovation and learning by doing and analyzes the impact of R&D and learning by doing on regional industrial development during the 12th FYP. Findings reveal consistency between the effect of “learning by doing” and “independent innovation” in technical progress during the 12th FYP, and the overall trend shows a V-shaped decline first and then later an increase. The heterogeneity of industrial structure in domestic regional economies present differences in independent innovation and learning by doing, among which the northeast region is highly sensitive to the effect of learning by doing. Therefore, strengthening the training of production departments and improving employee productivity are two key tasks in the northeast region. © 2021","progress bias, industrial structure adjustment, regional industrial economic growth motivation —— Research regional industrial transformation upgrading effect learning doing. new normal economy supply-side structural reform progress, industry pillar economic development, making urgent adjust upgrade country's industrial structure scientifically effectively. process industrial transformation development, progress key driving force, China, changes industrial sector began 12th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2011–2015).

Based on the strategic capability literature, this study examines the influence of social media strategic capability (SMSC) on disruptive innovation, the mediation role of organizational unlearning, and the moderating effects of top management team (TMT) heterogeneity and environmental dynamism. The empirical results from a sample of 198 Chinese manufacturing firms, each with paired respondents, show a significant association between SMSC and disruptive innovation, which is mediated by organizational unlearning. Furthermore, the effect of SMSC on unlearning is enhanced when SMEs have heterogeneous TMTs, and the influence of unlearning on disruptive innovation is strengthened in dynamic market and regulatory environments but weakened in dynamic technological environments.

This study discusses the double-edged sword role of inventor teams in innovation quality at two extremes: The high quality and the low quality. We argue that, inventor team size influences innovation quality because diversity works in the evolutionary process of innovation, but different types of diversity play distinct moderating roles in these relationships. Using patent data from the US pharmaceutical industry, empirical results show that there is an inverted U-shape relationship between inventor team size and high-quality innovation, and a negative relationship between inventor team size and low-quality innovation. These relationships are moderated at different degree by technological and geographic diversity. Our findings contribute to existing literature of innovation and also provide meaningful implications for innovation management. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.

Although teamwork shows stronger innovation ability than individuals and this advantage has been increasing over time, the negative effects of larger teams also appear as the number of inventor members increases. This study discusses the double-edged sword role of inventor teams in innovation quality at two extremes: The high quality and the low quality. We argue that, inventor team size influences innovation quality because diversity works in the evolutionary process of innovation, but different types of diversity play distinct moderating roles in these relationships. Using patent data from the US pharmaceutical industry, empirical results show that there is an inverted U-shape relationship between inventor team size and high-quality innovation, and a negative relationship between inventor team size and low-quality innovation. These relationships are moderated at different degree by technological and geographic diversity. Our findings contribute to existing literature of innovation and also provide meaningful implications for innovation management. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.

However, this concept tends to highlight only technical aspects of technology and market evolution. In order to provide a more comprehensive picture, the concept of sociotechnical alignment is explored here. The field of 3D bioprinting (the production of biological structures with automated, computer-controlled bioprinters) is focused on here. In the emergent global bioprinting market, companies have relied on three core technologies (tissue engineering, additive manufacturing, and software development) and continue to receive inputs from other technologies. On the biological side, bioprinting has benefited from new approaches such as the use of induced pluripotent stem cells. On the engineering side, it has been possible to use relatively cheap technologies such as open-source processing Arduino boards. On the software side, the proliferation of open source packages has strengthened the possibilities of bioprinting. The combination between these and other technology fringes involves a process of sociotechnical alignment whereby technical, scientific, and political issues are always at play. As a result, different companies have been able to realize different market strategies, having varied geographical reach. However, the first movements towards extensive globalization can also be noticed. In this way, the current diversity of the bioprinting market may be jeopardized in the years to come. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",3D bioprinting; Arduino; Induced pluripotent stem cells; Open source software; Sociotechnical alignment; Technology convergence,Alignment; Biology; Commerce; Open source software; Open systems; Software design; Stem cells; Tissue engineering; Biological structures; Hybrid technology; Induced pluripotent stem cells; Market evolution; Market strategies; Open source package; Technical aspects; Technology convergence; 3D printers; cell organelle; computer simulation; innovation; software; technological change; technological development; three-dimensional modeling,"Caviggioli, F., Technology fusion: identification and analysis of the drivers of technology convergence using patent data (2016) Technovation, 55-56, pp. 22-32; Adams, T.L., Taricani, E., Pitasi, A., The technological convergence innovation (2018) Int.

Using Chinese firm-year observations spanning 2008–2016, we find that the positive impact of board cultural diversity on corporate innovativeness is more (less) pronounced for Chinese firms subjecting to a low (high) level of local government intervention. Further, we find that foreign directors from countries with lower power distance, and greater individualism, long-term orientation and indulgence indexes relative to China, more (less) successfully facilitate corporate innovativeness, particularly when the level of local government intervention is low (high).

Further, we find that foreign directors from countries with lower power distance, and greater individualism, long-term orientation and indulgence indexes relative to China, more (less) successfully facilitate corporate innovativeness, particularly when the level of local government intervention is low (high).

In this study, we examine how mimetic and coercive institutional pressures moderate the relationship between TMT heterogeneity and product exploration. Using data obtained from 141 U.S. manufacturers, we show that this relationship is stronger when mimetic and coercive pressures are conflicting. We argue that this occurs because inconsistency between these institutional pressures creates a complex decision-making situation for the TMT. In such situations, a heterogeneous TMT is beneficial. The opposite result occurs when these pressures are consistent (e.g., both are high). Our results have implications for research and decisions regarding TMT composition and exploration strategies. They also highlight the need to appreciate the varied influences of institutional pressures on the firm. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Exploratory innovation; Institutional complexity; Institutional pressure; New product development; Product exploration; Top management team heterogeneity,,"Abrahamson, E., Managerial fads and fashions: The diffusion and rejection of innovations (1991) Academy of Management Review, 16 (3), pp. 586-612; Aksoy, L., Cooil, B., Groening, C., Keiningham, T.L., Yalçın, A., The long-term stock market valuation of customer satisfaction (2008) Journal of Marketing, 72 (4), pp. 105-122; Alexiev, A.S., Jansen, J.J., Van den Bosch, F.A., Volberda, H.W., Top management team advice seeking and exploratory innovation: The moderating role of TMT heterogeneity (2010) Journal of Management Studies, 47 (7), pp. 1343-1364; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 411-423; Atuahene-Gima, K., Resolving the capability–rigidity paradox in new product innovation (2005) Journal of Marketing, 69 (4), pp. 61-83; Autry, C.W., Golicic, S.L., Evaluating buyer–supplier relationship–performance spirals: A longitudinal study (2010) Journal of Operations Management, 28 (2), pp. 87-100; Bantel, K.A., Jackson, S.E., Top management and innovations in banking: Does the composition of the top team make a difference?

Past research suggests that although heterogeneity in the top management team (TMT) is associated with exploratory innovation, this may be contingent on factors in the firm's external environment. In this study, we examine how mimetic and coercive institutional pressures moderate the relationship between TMT heterogeneity and product exploration. Using data obtained from 141 U.S. manufacturers, we show that this relationship is stronger when mimetic and coercive pressures are conflicting. We argue that this occurs because inconsistency between these institutional pressures creates a complex decision-making situation for the TMT. In such situations, a heterogeneous TMT is beneficial. The opposite result occurs when these pressures are consistent (e.g., both are high). Our results have implications for research and decisions regarding TMT composition and exploration strategies. They also highlight the need to appreciate the varied influences of institutional pressures on the firm. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","management team heterogeneity beneficial product exploration?

Going beyond prior studies that exclusively focus on how family governance and management factors determine research and development (R&D) investment decisions, this study investigates a family science factor: family firm owner's birth order, defined as the relative rank of the owner in terms of the age hierarchy among siblings in the family. Joining the family niche model of birth order and socioemotional wealth perspective, we propose that later-born family firm owners tend to be risk-takers and invest more in R&D projects compared with their earlier-born counterparts. We further examine how the two other powerful decision-makers within family firms (i.e., chairperson of the board and CEO) enable or constrain the owner's birth order–R&D investment relationship. We contend that the positive birth order impact on R&D investment is weaker when a family member is the chairperson of the board, while such a relationship is stronger in the presence of owner–CEO duality. We confirm our hypotheses using a sample of 605 firm-year observations from Chinese-listed family firms between 2006 and 2014.

Family background has a significant impact on family firms’ strategies such as innovation investments. Going beyond prior studies that exclusively focus on how family governance and management factors determine research and development (R&D) investment decisions, this study investigates a family science factor: family firm owner's birth order, defined as the relative rank of the owner in terms of the age hierarchy among siblings in the family. Joining the family niche model of birth order and socioemotional wealth perspective, we propose that later-born family firm owners tend to be risk-takers and invest more in R&D projects compared with their earlier-born counterparts. We further examine how the two other powerful decision-makers within family firms (i.e., chairperson of the board and CEO) enable or constrain the owner's birth order–R&D investment relationship. We contend that the positive birth order impact on R&D investment is weaker when a family member is the chairperson of the board, while such a relationship is stronger in the presence of owner–CEO duality. We confirm our hypotheses using a sample of 605 firm-year observations from Chinese-listed family firms between 2006 and 2014.

Envisioning this momentum, the National Academy of Engineering in 2004 proposed ten key attributes that engineers by the year 2020 must possess to embrace the transformations. Although previous research found engineering undergraduates accruing The Engineer of 2020 (E2020) attributes from various pathways, including learning activities taking place outside of the college classroom, fewer studies have examined disciplinary outcomes and underrepresented populations. This paper explores how civil engineering undergraduates accrued E2020 attributes from out-of-class activities and examined the findings through the lens of diversity by disaggregating by gender, race/ethnicity, first-generation college status, disability status, and sexual orientation. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze a sample of 320 US civil engineering undergraduates who are graduating in the year 2020 and beyond. The results indicated that students from underrepresented groups (female; African American, Hispanic, American Indian, and multiracial; and first-generation college) indicated stronger agreement that they accrued E2020 attributes in out-of-class activities than students from overrepresented groups (male; White and Asian; and continuing generation in college). Students in overrepresented populations accrued most outcomes from their participation in jobs and sports. In addition to jobs, female and first-generation college students indicated that the design competition team was the setting in which they perceived the most outcomes. Professional experience and music/dance were frequently cited as impactful by subsamples of African American, Hispanic, American Indian, multiracial, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ)+ students, respectively.

The accelerating pace of technological innovation, coupled with social, cultural, political, and economic forces, have rapidly transformed the practice of engineering with unique implications for civil engineers in 2020 and beyond. Envisioning this momentum, the National Academy of Engineering in 2004 proposed ten key attributes that engineers by the year 2020 must possess to embrace the transformations. Although previous research found engineering undergraduates accruing The Engineer of 2020 (E2020) attributes from various pathways, including learning activities taking place outside of the college classroom, fewer studies have examined disciplinary outcomes and underrepresented populations. This paper explores how civil engineering undergraduates accrued E2020 attributes from out-of-class activities and examined the findings through the lens of diversity by disaggregating by gender, race/ethnicity, first-generation college status, disability status, and sexual orientation. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze a sample of 320 US civil engineering undergraduates who are graduating in the year 2020 and beyond. The results indicated that students from underrepresented groups (female; African American, Hispanic, American Indian, and multiracial; and first-generation college) indicated stronger agreement that they accrued E2020 attributes in out-of-class activities than students from overrepresented groups (male; White and Asian; and continuing generation in college). Students in overrepresented populations accrued most outcomes from their participation in jobs and sports. In addition to jobs, female and first-generation college students indicated that the design competition team was the setting in which they perceived the most outcomes. Professional experience and music/dance were frequently cited as impactful by subsamples of African American, Hispanic, American Indian, multiracial, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ)+ students, respectively. The results highlight the importance of out-of-class activities for undergraduates in civil engineering, especially for students belonging to underrepresented populations.

It also champions strategy-by-doing in entrepreneurial settings. This study juxtaposes and bridges these two perspectives to better understand product development. We propose that while a firm's product portfolio diversity contributes to new product success only to a certain degree, design iteration—a postlaunch strategy-by-doing approach—is positively associated with new product performance. Our core contribution points to a complementary relationship: strategy-by-doing helps mitigate the capacity constraints problem that prevents firms from successfully adapting product development capabilities to a dynamic market. Our analysis of a sample of 2,182 nascent mobile apps from 564 top producers in the U.S. market supports our hypotheses. We discuss implications for product development, strategy-by-doing, and technology innovation literature. Managerial Summary: Successful product development establishes firms' competitive advantage. The burgeoning digital economy increasingly prompts product development to depend on strategy-by-doing and requires firms to adapt a product's design over its lifecycle. Through analyzing a sample of newly launched mobile apps in the U.S. market, we find that while a firm's product portfolio diversity improves new product success to a certain degree, design iteration, a distinct approach to strategy-by-doing, underpins a new product's continual attractiveness to users.

Research Summary: Strategy research views firms' diverse experience base as critical to new product success. It also champions strategy-by-doing in entrepreneurial settings. This study juxtaposes and bridges these two perspectives to better understand product development. We propose that while a firm's product portfolio diversity contributes to new product success only to a certain degree, design iteration—a postlaunch strategy-by-doing approach—is positively associated with new product performance. Our core contribution points to a complementary relationship: strategy-by-doing helps mitigate the capacity constraints problem that prevents firms from successfully adapting product development capabilities to a dynamic market. Our analysis of a sample of 2,182 nascent mobile apps from 564 top producers in the U.S. market supports our hypotheses. We discuss implications for product development, strategy-by-doing, and technology innovation literature. Managerial Summary: Successful product development establishes firms' competitive advantage. The burgeoning digital economy increasingly prompts product development to depend on strategy-by-doing and requires firms to adapt a product's design over its lifecycle. Through analyzing a sample of newly launched mobile apps in the U.S. market, we find that while a firm's product portfolio diversity improves new product success to a certain degree, design iteration, a distinct approach to strategy-by-doing, underpins a new product's continual attractiveness to users. Moreover, frequent design iterations can overcome the barriers that innovator firms face when applying a diverse repertoire of experiences to product development. © 2020 Strategic Management Society","Experience base, strategy-by-doing new product performance.

To address this gap, we draw on the differentiation-integration framework of ambidexterity theory to deconstruct tactics for fostering ambidextrous innovation in infrastructure projects. A total of 313 observations were collected from infrastructure under construction, and the path hypotheses were tested by hierarchical regression. The findings suggest that in infrastructure projects, task conflict and expertise integration of diverse cross-functional teams provide powerful and complementary tactics for fostering ambidextrous innovation. The moderating effect of team autonomy support on the impact of team diversity on differentiation and integration tactics presents three different results. This study not only enriches the literature on how to foster ambidextrous innovation in infrastructure projects but also expands the ambidexterity research at the cross-functional team level and in infrastructure project contexts. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Ambidextrous innovation; Cross-functional team; Expertise integration; Task conflict; Team autonomy support; Team diversity,Civil engineering; Engineering; Ambidexterity theories; Combined effect; Cross-functional teams; Expertise integration; Hierarchical regression; Infrastructure project; Integration frameworks; Moderating effect; Integral equations,"Amason, A.C., Distinguishing the effects of functional and disfunctional conflict on strategic decision making: Resolving a paradox for top management teams (1996) Acad.

In infrastructure project practice, balancing and maximizing the combined effect of exploratory and exploitative innovation have attracted increasing attention, but it is still unclear how to foster ambidextrous innovation in infrastructure projects. To address this gap, we draw on the differentiation-integration framework of ambidexterity theory to deconstruct tactics for fostering ambidextrous innovation in infrastructure projects. A total of 313 observations were collected from infrastructure under construction, and the path hypotheses were tested by hierarchical regression. The findings suggest that in infrastructure projects, task conflict and expertise integration of diverse cross-functional teams provide powerful and complementary tactics for fostering ambidextrous innovation. The moderating effect of team autonomy support on the impact of team diversity on differentiation and integration tactics presents three different results. This study not only enriches the literature on how to foster ambidextrous innovation in infrastructure projects but also expands the ambidexterity research at the cross-functional team level and in infrastructure project contexts. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Fostering Ambidextrous Innovation Infrastructure Projects: Differentiation Integration Tactics Cross-Functional Teams. infrastructure project practice, balancing maximizing combined effect exploratory exploitative innovation attracted increasing attention, unclear foster ambidextrous innovation infrastructure projects. address gap, draw differentiation-integration framework ambidexterity theory deconstruct tactics fostering ambidextrous innovation infrastructure projects. 313 observations collected infrastructure construction, path hypotheses tested hierarchical regression. findings suggest infrastructure projects, task conflict expertise integration diverse cross-functional teams provide powerful complementary tactics fostering ambidextrous innovation. moderating effect team autonomy support impact team diversity differentiation integration tactics presents different results. study enriches foster ambidextrous innovation infrastructure projects expands ambidexterity research cross-functional team level infrastructure project contexts. © 2021 American Society Civil Engineers.","[[""fostering"", ""ambidextrous"", ""innovation"", ""infrastructure"", ""projects"", ""differentiation"", ""integration"", ""tactics"", ""cross"", ""functional"", ""teams""], [""infrastructure"", ""project"", ""practice"", ""balancing"", ""maximizing"", ""combined"", ""effect"", ""exploratory"", ""exploitative"", ""innovation"", ""attracted"", ""increasing"", ""attention"", ""unclear"", ""foster"", ""ambidextrous"", ""innovation"", ""infrastructure"", ""projects""], [""address"", ""gap"", ""draw"", ""differentiation"", ""integration"", ""framework"", ""ambidexterity"", ""theory"", ""deconstruct"", ""tactics"", ""fostering"", ""ambidextrous"", ""innovation"", ""infrastructure"", ""projects""], [""observations"", ""collected"", ""infrastructure"", ""construction"", ""path"", ""hypotheses"", ""tested"", ""hierarchical"", ""regression""], [""findings"", ""suggest"", ""infrastructure"", ""projects"", ""task"", ""conflict"", ""expertise"", ""integration"", ""diverse"", ""cross"", ""functional"", ""teams"", ""provide"", ""powerful"", ""complementary"", ""tactics"", ""fostering"", ""ambidextrous"", ""innovation""], [""moderating"", ""effect"", ""team"", ""autonomy"", ""support"", ""impact"", ""team"", ""diversity"", ""differentiation"", ""integration"", ""tactics"", ""presents"", ""different"", ""results""], [""study"", ""enriches"", ""foster"", ""ambidextrous"", ""innovation"", ""infrastructure"", ""projects"", ""expands"", ""ambidexterity"", ""research"", ""cross"", ""functional"", ""team"", ""level"", ""infrastructure"", ""project"", ""contexts""], [""american"", ""society"", ""civil"", ""engineers""]]"

We find that well-connected boards have a positive effect on innovation activities and quality. The effect is stronger when firms have higher demand for advising or face more severe agency problems. Firms with greater needs for external finance benefit more from board connections with bankers. We show that the positive relation is causal and robust based on a battery of empirical tests including exogenous variation in board connectedness resulting from death and retirement of directors and from a regulatory shock under new exchange listing rules. Evidence indicates that types and relatedness of connections as well as director characteristics contribute to cross-sectional heterogeneity of the positive effect.

This paper studies whether board connectedness affects corporate innovation. We find that well-connected boards have a positive effect on innovation activities and quality. The effect is stronger when firms have higher demand for advising or face more severe agency problems. Firms with greater needs for external finance benefit more from board connections with bankers. We show that the positive relation is causal and robust based on a battery of empirical tests including exogenous variation in board connectedness resulting from death and retirement of directors and from a regulatory shock under new exchange listing rules. Evidence indicates that types and relatedness of connections as well as director characteristics contribute to cross-sectional heterogeneity of the positive effect.

Do teams need to include inventors with knowledge breadth for recombination or do they need inventors with knowledge depth for identifying anomalies? Do teams need overlapping knowledge to integrate insights from diverse areas or does this redundancy hamper innovation by creating inefficiencies? In this article, we offer evidence that the answers to these questions may depend on the characteristics of the technologies. Focusing on the degree of modularity and the breadth of application in patent data, we identify empirical patterns suggesting that differing team configurations are associated with different technological domains. Managerial Summary: While innovation has increasingly become a collaborative effort, there is little guidance for managers about how you can construct teams to create novel breakthroughs. Who should be on the team? Some have suggested that inventors should have broad knowledge in order to facilitate the recombination of ideas, which is at the heart of creativity.

Research Summary: While innovation has increasingly become a collaborative effort, there is little consensus in research about what types of team configurations might be the most useful for creating breakthrough innovations. Do teams need to include inventors with knowledge breadth for recombination or do they need inventors with knowledge depth for identifying anomalies? Do teams need overlapping knowledge to integrate insights from diverse areas or does this redundancy hamper innovation by creating inefficiencies? In this article, we offer evidence that the answers to these questions may depend on the characteristics of the technologies. Focusing on the degree of modularity and the breadth of application in patent data, we identify empirical patterns suggesting that differing team configurations are associated with different technological domains. Managerial Summary: While innovation has increasingly become a collaborative effort, there is little guidance for managers about how you can construct teams to create novel breakthroughs. Who should be on the team? Some have suggested that inventors should have broad knowledge in order to facilitate the recombination of ideas, which is at the heart of creativity. Others suggest that only deep knowledge in an area can lead to novel solutions. How much diversity in backgrounds is useful?

Particular attention has been paid to the function of repair and maintenance in the railway context. Repair and maintenance have therefore been considered complex phenomena bringing together infrastructure, things to be repaired or maintained, and people involved in these actions on the one hand, and field research, innovation and business on the other. Based on a broad range of sources regarding the legal prescriptions, statistics, reports of railway employees to their superiors, financial documentation, and drafts of repaired locomotives, the diversity of the repair and maintenance of locomotives in late imperial Russia is analysed. © The Author(s) 2021.",appropriation; locomotion industry; Repair; reuse; Russian railways,innovation; nineteenth century; railway transport; repair and maintenance; technology transfer; twentieth century; Russian Federation,"] (Kiev: Tipografiya i svetopechat’ S.

New insights from the Ryazan–Uralsk private railway (Russia, 1890–1914). This paper provides an overview of the practices of the repair, maintenance, and appropriation of locomotives on Russian railways at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, exemplified by a case study of the Ryazan–Uralsk railway. Particular attention has been paid to the function of repair and maintenance in the railway context. Repair and maintenance have therefore been considered complex phenomena bringing together infrastructure, things to be repaired or maintained, and people involved in these actions on the one hand, and field research, innovation and business on the other. Based on a broad range of sources regarding the legal prescriptions, statistics, reports of railway employees to their superiors, financial documentation, and drafts of repaired locomotives, the diversity of the repair and maintenance of locomotives in late imperial Russia is analysed. © The Author(s) 2021.","repair maintenance locomotives sources innovation transfer.

This is in contrast to engineering or marketing perspectives on packaging functions that often don’t take practical demands and habitual peculiarities of everyday work practices into consideration. Framed as a code of practice, packaging guides the daily management of food in three crucial ways. First, packaging is a multifunctional medium to present products to customers. Second, packaging is an indicator and transmitter to assess product quantities and qualities in the internal logistics of supermarkets.

From a theoretical perspective, CCIs drive economic development and local innovative capacity by facilitating processes of cross-fertilization of ideas. This study estimates an entry model analysing the ability of Italian provinces to successfully create new sectoral specializations. The results indicate that the relationship between the share of employees in CCIs and the probability of creating new sectoral specializations is non-linear, highlighting the need for CCIs-led policies to achieve a certain level of critical mass to be successful. © 2020 The Authors.
